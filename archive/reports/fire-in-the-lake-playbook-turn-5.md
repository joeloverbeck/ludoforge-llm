# Fire in the Lake - Playbook Turn 5

**Status**: COMPLETED

## GAME TURN 5, Brinks Hotel

The 1st Eligible VC faction chooses to execute the shaded Event
text (5.2) in Hue City, where they have a Guerrilla. Adjust the blue
Eligibility token to reflect the Event play.
First Shift Hue City 2 levels, from Neutral to Active Opposition
(place marker). As a result, move the VC victory token on the Track
from 23 to 27 (Active Opposition is twice the space’s 2 population
value, so 4). Then place a Terror maker in Hue, without further effect
for now (Control of the City is unaffected by the Terror).
Note that the Event effects represent a dramatic VC act of terror in
the City. For an Insurgent Terror Operation (3.3.4), a Guerrilla must
flip from Underground to Active, but this is different. Carrying out
the Event text literally, it states only that VC need to be present in
the space, so the VC Guerrilla in Hue keeps its same status (i.e., it
remains Underground).
The VC player-turn is done as they have finished executing the Event.
As 2nd Eligible, the ARVN decide to Pass; place their yellow Eligibility token in the Pass box and adjust the ARVN resources marker
on the track up 3 spaces (from 24 to 27).
There are no more Eligible factions to consider, so the turn is over.
Reset the Eligibility tokens (3 factions will be Eligible next turn,
with only the VC being Ineligible), show Henry Cabot Lodge as
the current card by placing it atop Brinks Hotel, and reveal the next
preview card (Booby Traps) for Turn 7.
