# Fire in the Lake - Playbook Turn 8 Coup

Now that a Coup! round is about to occur, refer to the bottom half
of the Sequence of Play aid sheet that describes the Coup Card
sequence in detail. It’s important to carefully conduct these phases
in order, step-by-step. You also can track the phases with the Coup
Card marker on the game board’s Sequence of Play track.
We must first address the RVN leader situation. Our Coup! card,
Nguyen Khanh, is placed in the RVN Leader box on the map (covering up Minh, who is no longer a part of play). Khanh limits the
ARVN Transport (4.3.2) Special Ability to use of just 1 LoC, and no
further, for the coming campaign. This has no effect at the present
time, however, so we can move on.
Victory? (6.1): Checking rules section 7.2, we see that none of the
four factions have met their victory condition thresholds, so this
phase is done.
Resources (6.2): No Insurgents occupy any LoCs, and there is COIN
Control in all Cities on the map, so there will be no Sabotage (6.2.1)
this round. The Economic Value of South Vietnam remains at 15
(this is the sum total of all LoCs on the map, 1.3.4).
Next, the Trail would be degraded 1 box if there was COIN Control
in any space in Laos or Cambodia (6.2.2). Since there isn’t, the Trail
is unaffected.
ARVN earnings will be equal to the current Aid (which is at 14) and
the Economic Value of all un-sabotaged LoCs (which is 15), for a
total of 29 (6.2.3). Adjust the ARVN resource marker from 18 to 47
(note the maximum resources for any faction is 75, 1.8).
Insurgent earnings (6.2.4) differ for the VC and NVA, and are calculated separately. The VC get 1 resource for each Base (including
a Tunneled Base) that they have anywhere on the map, which in this
case is 7. Adjust the VC resource marker from 10 to 17. The NVA
will receive 3 resources for their 3 Bases in Laos/Cambodia (but
not for their Base in North Vietnam), plus double the current Trail
Value which is 1 (2 x 1 = 2). So move the NVA resource marker up
a total of 5 spaces (3 + 2), to 7.
There is 1 US Troop cube in the Casualties box, so lower Aid by
3 (3 x 1), moving that marker from 14 to 11 (6.2.5). Leave the US
Troop cube in the Casualty box for now; we will deal with it shortly.
Support (6.3): The US first, and then the ARVN, may now spend
resources in up to 4 spaces (total between the two factions) to conduct
Pacification (6.3.1) where there exists COIN Control, that faction’s
Troops, and also ARVN Police. If any of these three conditions are
not met, then Pacification cannot occur in that space. A qualifying
space may be Pacified up to 2 levels towards Active Support in
this phase.
The US first considers Hue City, which meets the listed requirements
to Pacify. There is a Terror marker present, so the US must first
spend 3 ARVN resources to remove that marker. Adjust the ARVN
resource marker from 47 to 44. The US continues by spending 6
more ARVN resources (a cost of 3 resources per level) to shift Hue
by 2 levels towards Active Support (dropping ARVN resources
from 44 to 38). Since Hue is currently at Active Opposition, this
results in the Active Opposition marker now being removed. Lower
the blue VC “Oppose+Bases” victory point token from 27 to 23 (2
shifts x 2 population) to reflect this change. The US victory point
token doesn’t change because there is no Support in Hue (the City
is now back to Neutral).
US Pacification of 1 level in Saigon then reduces ARVN resources
from 38 to 35 (adjust marker). Flip over the Passive Support marker
in the space to Active Support. Since the population of Saigon is 6,
and Support was just increased 1 level, the US victory point token is
shifted up 6 boxes from 42 to 48. The US is just a few boxes away
from its victory point goal of exceeding 50. But even if they had
passed that threshold now it wouldn’t matter until the next Coup!
card was resolved, since we have already evaluated victory (6.1) for
this particular Coup Round. The exception to this would be if this
was the last Coup! card of the game (see 6.4.5).
The US has conducted Pacification in 2 spaces; they could continue
on (in up to 2 more candidate spaces), but decide not to. The ARVN
now have the opportunity to Pacify in 2 spaces (bringing the total to
the maximum allowed of 4 spaces), but they decline to do so because
they want to conserve resources and also don’t want to catapult their
US ally too far ahead in the game.
The VC may now perform Agitation (6.3.2) in up to 4 spaces where
they have any pieces and also which do not have COIN Control,
potentially shifting each up to 2 levels. While the VC do have a
Guerrilla in Hue City, they cannot Agitate there because of the COIN
Control. Quang Tri, Quang Tin, Quang Duc, and Binh Tuy Provinces
all show Passive Opposition; by Agitating in each of these spaces,
the VC can shift each 1 level up towards Active Opposition. They do
so, spending 1 resource per space to Agitate, lowering their resources
from 17 to 13. Flip the Passive Opposition markers in those 4 spaces
to Active Opposition, and increase the VC victory points by 6 (2 +
2 + 1 +1, the sum population total of all four spaces which received
the 1 level Opposition shifts), from 23 to 29.
Redeploy (6.4): All US and ARVN pieces in Laos and Cambodia
would now be removed, US Troop cubes (and, in a highly unlikely
case, US Bases) going Out of Play and all other pieces to Available
(6.4.1). Since there are no COIN pieces currently in Laos/Cambodia,
we can bypass this step.
Now the ARVN (not the US) will perform Redeploy (6.4.2). All
ARVN Troop cubes in Provinces without any US or ARVN Base
and LoCs (not Cities) must Redeploy (and others may) to any Cities
without NVA Control, any US/ARVN Base space, or to Saigon (they
are returning to garrison). Checking Binh Dinh, the 2 ARVN Troop
cubes there must leave: the ARVN decide to move 1 Troop cube
to the City of Qui Nhon and 1 to Da Nang. The 6 ARVN Troops in
Pleiku may stay due to the presence of the US Base, or they or any
other ARVN Troops could choose to Redeploy. The ARVN choose
to leave their remaining Troops in place.
The ARVN Ranger in Quang Tri is not a Troop cube so it is unaffected by Redeployment, and also remains in the space.
The ARVN then has the option to move its Police to any LoCs or
to any COIN-Controlled spaces anywhere in South Vietnam. The
ARVN decide to take 1 Police from Saigon and place it on the key
2-Econ LoC that connects westward to the City of Can Tho; place
the cube in the (2) circle on the LoC. This will help guard the LoC
against possible Insurgent Terror (Sabotage) on future turns.
Being content with the locations of their other Police units, the
ARVN conducts no further repositioning. The US suggests Redeploying some Police to help Pacify Pleiku-Darlac, but ARVN decline.
The NVA may then Redeploy (6.4.3) their Troops (not Guerrillas)
to any NVA Bases, even to spaces that show COIN Control. The
NVA have 5 Troops in Southern Laos; they choose to take 4 of those
cubes and shift them to North Vietnam, hoping to reinforce their
invasion of South Vietnam (Quang Tri Province) on a future turn.
Up to this point we have not adjusted Control of any space because
of any Redeployment, and that is intentional, but now it is time to do
so (6.4.4). Examining the entire map, we see that no space Control
has changed, so this step is over.
If this was the last Coup! card in the game, we would make a final victory determination (6.4.5). Since it is not, we will skip this step too.
Commitment (6.5): This applies only to the US faction. We need
to ascertain if any US Casualties will go Out of Play. The US has
1 Troop cube in the US Casualties box, and when divided by 3
(rounded down) we get 0, so no US Troops will leave play this
round. The Troop cube instead gets placed to the US Available
Forces box; this one cube grants the US 1 victory point, so adjust
their token from 48 to 49.
Now the US can freely move up to 10 of its Troops and 2 of its Bases
amongst the US Available Forces box, any COIN-Controlled spaces,
any LoCs, and/or Saigon. Removing Troops from the US Available
Forces box to the map (deploying them “in country”) will decrease
their victory points, while removing Troops from the map (withdrawing them “home”) to Available US Forces will increase US victory
points. Of course, those victory points will come at the expense of
being able to influence affairs in South Vietnam—including building
Support for the Republic of Vietnam that also makes up US victory.
The US takes its Troop cube from Binh Dinh and places it into the
City of Qui Nhon. Likewise, 1 US Troop from Saigon relocates to
the City of Can Tho, while another Troop from Saigon goes over to the City of Cam Ranh. Finally, 1 Troops from US Available deploys
to the City of An Loc; lower the US victory point marker from 49
to 48 for this cube’s map placement. These Troop adjustments potentially will allow the US to Pacify in these Cities at a future point
in the game, gaining additional victory points.
Reset (6.6): We’ll prepare for the next Event card (which is Sihanouk) by performing just a few more steps. If the Trail is at 4 or
0, it is adjusted a box, but our Trail is at 1 so there is no change.
There are no Terror or Sabotage markers to remove. All factions’
Guerrillas and Special Forces on the map flip back to Underground.
Any Momentum Event cards would now be discarded (their Event
effects no longer would apply), but we have none in play (the VC
Capability card Booby Traps remains in effect). All factions have
their cylinders moved to the Eligible box. Finally, Sihanouk shifts
over to be our current card for Turn 8, and Claymores is revealed
as the preview card for Turn 9.
