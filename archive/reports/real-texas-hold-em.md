## Real #1

Table setup (6-max tournament NLHE)

- Blinds / antes: 10 ante, SB 50, BB 100

- Dealer button: Seat 4 (Dave)

- Therefore: Seat 5 = Small Blind, Seat 6 = Big Blind

- Starting stacks:

-- Seat 1 (Alice): 2520

-- Seat 2 (Bob): 1830

-- Seat 3 (Carol): 950

-- Seat 4 (Dave): 1210

-- Seat 5 (Eve): 3350

-- Seat 6 (Frank): 780

Deterministic deck order (top to bottom)

J♦, 7♣, 4♥, Q♥, A♠, 9♠, T♦, 2♥, 4♣, Q♣, K♠, 5♦, 3♣, 8♠, 6♠, 2♠, J♣, Q♦, A♦, T♥, Q♠, J♠, T♠, 7♠, 5♠, 4♠, 3♠, A♥, K♥, J♥, 9♥, 8♥, 7♥, 6♥, 5♥, 3♥, K♦, 9♦, 8♦, 7♦, 6♦, 4♦, 3♦, 2♦, A♣, K♣, T♣, 9♣, 8♣, 6♣, 5♣, 2♣

Dealing order: first card to Seat 5, then 6, 1, 2, 3, 4; then repeat.

Antes + blinds

Everyone posts ante 10 (total antes = 60).
Seat 5 posts SB 50.
Seat 6 posts BB 100.

Hole cards (dealt from the deck order above)

- Seat 1 (Alice): 4♥ 4♣

- Seat 2 (Bob): Q♥ Q♣

- Seat 3 (Carol): A♠ K♠

- Seat 4 (Dave): 9♠ 5♦

- Seat 5 (Eve): J♦ T♦

- Seat 6 (Frank): 7♣ 2♥

Preflop action (button is Seat 4, so action starts at Seat 1)

1. Seat 1 raises to 250 total.

2. Seat 2 calls 250.

3. Seat 3 shoves all-in to 940 total. (Seat 3 is all-in.)

4. Seat 4 folds.

5. Seat 5 re-shoves all-in to 3340 total. (Seat 5 is all-in.)

6. Seat 6 folds. (after posting BB)

Now the calls versus Seat 5’s shove:

7. Seat 1 calls but is short and goes all-in for 2510 total.

7. Seat 2 calls but is short and goes all-in for 1820 total.

Important test detail:

- The largest amount any opponent can match is Seat 1’s 2510 (Seat 1 is the effective cap).

- So 830 of Seat 5’s shove is uncalled and must be returned to Seat 5 (because 3340 − 2510 = 830).

At this point, remaining players in the hand are Seats 1, 2, 3, 5 and all are all-in, so there is no further betting; the board runs out.

Board runout (with burns)

Burn: 3♣

Flop: 8♠ 6♠ 2♠

Burn: J♣

Turn: Q♦

Burn: A♦

River: T♥

Final board: 8♠ 6♠ 2♠ Q♦ T♥

Showdown (best hands)

Seat 3 (A♠ K♠): Ace-high flush in spades (A♠ K♠ 8♠ 6♠ 2♠)

Seat 2 (Q♥ Q♣): Three of a kind, Queens (Q♥ Q♣ Q♦ …)

Seat 5 (J♦ T♦): One pair, Tens (T♦ T♥ …)

Seat 1 (4♥ 4♣): One pair, Fours

So: Seat 3 beats everyone who’s eligible in the pots they’re in.

Exact pot breakdown (main + side pots)

Total money actually left in the pot after returning the uncalled 830 is 7940.

You get five pots (because stacks are different):

1. Pot A = 60 (all six antes). Eligible: Seats 1,2,3,5. Won by Seat 3.

2. Pot B = 500 (100 each from Seats 6,3,2,1,5). Eligible: Seats 1,2,3,5. Won by Seat 3.

3. Pot C = 3360 (840 each from Seats 3,2,1,5). Eligible: Seats 1,2,3,5. Won by Seat 3.

4. Pot D = 2640 (880 each from Seats 2,1,5). Eligible: Seats 1,2,5. Won by Seat 2.

5. Pot E = 1380 (690 each from Seats 1,5). Eligible: Seats 1,5. Won by Seat 5.

Winnings summary:

- Seat 3 wins Pots A+B+C = 3920

- Seat 2 wins Pot D = 2640

- Seat 5 wins Pot E = 1380

- Seat 1 wins nothing and is eliminated

Ending stacks (should reconcile exactly)

Seat 1: 0

Seat 2: 2640

Seat 3: 3920

Seat 4: 1200 (lost only the ante)

Seat 5: 2210

Seat 6: 670

Preflop

Action proceeds (as logged):

1. Seat 5 folds.

2. Seat 6 folds.

3. Seat 8 (Hero) raises to 480.

4. Seat 9 folds.

5. Seat 10 calls 480.

6. Seat 2 (button) folds.

7. Seat 3 (SB) folds.

8. Seat 4 (BB) folds.

Heads-up to the flop: Hero vs Seat 10.

Flop: 4♠ J♣ 7♦

1. Hero bets 929.

2. Seat 10 calls 929.

Turn: 7♠ (board now 4♠ J♣ 7♦ 7♠)

1. Hero bets 2230.

2. Seat 10 raises (puts in 4460 total for the turn, i.e. raises to 4460).

3. Hero re-raises (adds 5450 more; this makes Hero’s total on the turn 7680).

4. Seat 10 calls by adding 3220 more (matching the 7680).

River: J♦ (final board: 4♠ J♣ 7♦ 7♠ J♦)

1. Hero bets 88 and is all-in.

2. Seat 10 calls 88.

Showdown

- Hero shows Q♥ Q♣.

- Seat 10 shows 8♠ 9♠.

On this double-paired board, both players play J♣ J♦ 7♦ 7♠ plus a kicker:

- Hero’s kicker is Q → Jacks & Sevens, queen kicker

- Seat 10’s kicker is 9 → Jacks & Sevens, nine kicker

So Hero wins.

Pot result (useful for golden tests)

- The hand history records a single pot of 18,722, awarded to Hero.

- (And the amounts are internally consistent: antes 128 + blinds 240 + preflop 960 + flop 1858 + turn 15360 + river 176 = 18722.)

## Outcome

- Completion date: February 16, 2026
- What changed:
  - Implemented dedicated real-play e2e coverage in `test/e2e/texas-holdem-real-plays.test.ts`.
  - Replayed both documented hands action-by-action with deterministic deck/hole-card setup and per-action assertions.
  - Added a game-agnostic replay boundary control in kernel execution (`maxPhaseTransitionsPerMove`) to support strict stepwise transcript replay.
- Deviations from original plan:
  - Used full action-by-action replay assertions rather than only start/end-state checks.
- Verification results:
  - Both real-play replays pass in e2e.
  - Repository test suites pass with these changes (`npm test`, targeted `npm run test:e2e`).
