# Spec 128: Full-Scope Draft State for applyMove Boundary

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Priority**: P0
**Complexity**: XL
**Dependencies**: Spec 78 (scoped draft state — COMPLETED)
**Source**: `fitl-perf-optimization` campaign V8 profiling data (2026-04-13), 7 experiments across 5 prior perf campaigns

## Overview

Extend the existing `state-draft.ts` copy-on-write system from inner effect-execution scopes to the **entire `applyMove` boundary**. Convert all remaining kernel spread sites outside the draft machinery to use the draft system. Eliminate the remaining ~12% CPU overhead from immutable object spreads during state transitions.

**Spread site methodology**: A raw grep for `...(state|cursor\.state)` yields 61 matches across 18 kernel files, but 15 of those are in `state-draft.ts` itself (the draft machinery — not conversion targets). Additional sites use variable names like `...progressedState` or `...nextState`. The convertible site count (excluding draft infrastructure, `initial-state.ts` construction, `serde.ts` deserialization) is approximately 45-55 depending on counting methodology.

### Rationale

V8 CPU profiling of FITL (the most complex game spec, 130 event cards, 40+ actions) reveals that object allocation and copying dominate runtime cost:

| V8 Builtin | CPU % | Cause |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `Scavenger::ScavengeObject` (GC) | 4.5% | Allocation pressure from short-lived spread copies |
| `ScavengerCollector::CollectGarbage` | 1.5% | GC pauses from above |
| `CreateDataProperty` | 3.9% | Object property creation during spreads |
| `CloneObjectIC` + `CloneObjectIC_Slow` | 2.1% | Object cloning during spreads |
| **Total** | **~12%** | |

Seven experiments across the `fitl-perf-optimization` campaign proved that **any modification** to hot-path function internals causes V8 JIT deoptimization (2-5% regression per change). The only successful optimization was removing an entire redundant function call (-1.47%). The V8 JIT ceiling cannot be broken by micro-optimization — the remaining bottleneck is architectural.

### Foundation 11 Authorization

Foundation 11 (Immutability) explicitly carves out this optimization:

> *"Within a single synchronous effect-execution scope, the kernel MAY use a private draft state or copy-on-write working state for performance. That working state MUST be fully isolated from caller-visible state: no shared mutable descendants, no aliasing that can leak outside the scope, and no observation before finalization. The external contract remains `applyMove(state) -> newState`, where the input `state` is never modified. This guarantee MUST be enforced by regression tests."*

The existing Spec 78 implementation (`state-draft.ts`) satisfies these constraints within `applyEffectsWithBudgetState` scopes. This spec extends the same guarantees to the full `applyMove` boundary.

### Current State (Spec 78)

The draft system exists but its coverage is narrow:

- **Covered**: Effect handlers inside `applyEffectsWithBudgetState` — `setVar`, `moveToken`, `setMarkerState`, `createToken`, `destroyToken`
- **Not covered (45-55 convertible spread sites)**:
  - `apply-move.ts` — lifecycle phase transitions, turn order updates, free operation state, hash computation boundary (~10 spread sites including `...progressedState`, `...nextState` variants)
  - `turn-flow-lifecycle.ts` — turn flow lifecycle state updates (7 spread sites)
  - `turn-flow-eligibility.ts` — eligibility window state updates (4-6 spread sites)
  - `effects-markers.ts` — global marker state transitions (7 spread sites in immutable fallback path; already has dual-path draft logic from Spec 78)
  - `effects-turn-flow.ts` — turn flow effect state updates (2-5 spread sites)
  - `phase-advance.ts` — phase advance state transitions (4-8 spread sites including `...progressedState` variants)
  - `action-usage.ts` — action usage tracking updates (4 spread sites)
  - `effects-token.ts` — zone mutation finalization (2-4 spread sites outside draft scope)
  - `effects-reveal.ts` — reveal state updates (2 spread sites)
  - `event-execution.ts` — event state updates (1 spread site)
  - `grant-lifecycle.ts`, `scoped-var-runtime-access.ts`, `free-operation-viability.ts` — minor spread sites (1 each)

These uncovered sites create new GameState objects via `{ ...state, field: newValue }` — each copying 15+ top-level properties plus nested record contents.

## Deliverables

### 1. Widen Draft Scope to applyMove Boundary

**Current scope**: `applyEffectsWithBudgetState` creates a mutable state and DraftTracker at the start of each effect execution batch. Multiple batches within a single `applyMove` each create their own draft.

**New scope**: The `applyMoveCore` function (the single entry point for all state transitions) creates ONE mutable state + DraftTracker at the top. All downstream code — effect execution, lifecycle phase transitions, turn order updates, hash computation — operates on this single draft. The draft is frozen to immutable GameState at the `applyMoveCore` exit.

```
BEFORE (Spec 78):
  applyMoveCore(immutableState)
    → executeMoveAction(immutableState)
      → applyEffectsWithBudgetState(immutableState)  // creates draft #1
        → setVar (mutates draft #1)
        → forEach
          → applyEffectsWithBudgetState(draft #1)   // creates draft #2 (REDUNDANT)
            → moveToken (mutates draft #2)
        → freeze draft #2, merge back
      → freeze draft #1
    → applyTurnFlowEligibilityAfterMove({...state})  // SPREAD — new immutable state
    → applyReleasedDeferredEventEffects({...state})   // SPREAD — another copy
    → applyBoundaryExpiry({...state})                 // SPREAD — another copy
    → advanceToDecisionPoint({...state})              // SPREAD — another copy
    → { ...progressedState, stateHash, _runningHash } // SPREAD — final copy

AFTER (Spec 128):
  applyMoveCore(immutableState)
    → createMutableState(immutableState)              // ONE draft for entire applyMoveCore
    → executeMoveAction(mutableState, tracker)
      → applyEffectsWithBudgetState(mutableState, tracker)  // reuses existing draft
        → setVar (mutates in-place)
        → forEach
          → applyEffectsWithBudgetState(mutableState, tracker)  // reuses existing draft
            → moveToken (mutates in-place)
    → applyTurnFlowEligibilityAfterMove(mutableState, tracker)  // mutates state in-place, returns non-state fields
    → applyReleasedDeferredEventEffects(mutableState, tracker)  // mutates state in-place, returns non-state fields
    → applyBoundaryExpiry(mutableState, tracker)      // mutates state in-place, returns non-state fields
    → advanceToDecisionPoint(mutableState, tracker)   // mutates in-place
    → mutableState.stateHash = reconciledHash         // direct assignment, no spread
    → freezeState(mutableState)                       // ONE freeze at exit
```

### 2. Convert Lifecycle State Updates to Draft Mutations

Each of the ~45-55 convertible `...state` spread sites must be converted to direct property assignment on the mutable state. Examples:

**Before** (turn-flow-eligibility.ts):
```typescript
return {
  ...state,
  currentPhase: nextPhase,
  turnOrderState: { ...state.turnOrderState, pending: newPending },
};
```

**After**:
```typescript
state.currentPhase = nextPhase;
ensureTurnOrderCloned(state, tracker);
state.turnOrderState.pending = newPending;
// no return — state is mutated in-place
```

The conversion pattern for each spread site:
1. Replace `{ ...state, field: value }` with `state.field = value`
2. For nested objects (`state.turnOrderState`, `state.markers`, etc.), use COW helpers: `ensureXCloned(state, tracker)` before mutation
3. Change the function's return type from `GameState` to `void` (or thread the mutable state through parameters)

### 3. Extend DraftTracker for New COW Domains

Add tracking for domains not covered by Spec 78:

```typescript
export interface DraftTracker {
  // Existing (Spec 78)
  readonly playerVars: Set<number>;
  readonly zoneVars: Set<string>;
  readonly zones: Set<string>;
  readonly markers: Set<string>;
  // New (Spec 128)
  readonly globalMarkers: boolean;
  readonly turnOrderState: boolean;
  readonly reveals: boolean;
  readonly activeLastingEffects: boolean;
  readonly interruptPhaseStack: boolean;
  readonly actionUsage: boolean;
}
```

Each new boolean tracks whether the corresponding nested object/array has been shallow-cloned. The boolean pattern (vs Set) is appropriate for singleton nested objects (only one `turnOrderState`, not one per zone).

### 4. Thread Mutable State Through Lifecycle Functions

Functions that currently accept `GameState` and return a new `GameState` must be refactored to accept `MutableGameState` + `DraftTracker` and mutate in-place:

| Function | File | Current return type | New signature notes |
|----------|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| `advanceToDecisionPoint` | `phase-advance.ts` | `GameState` | Accept `MutableGameState` + `DraftTracker`, mutate in-place, return `void` |
| `applyTurnFlowEligibilityAfterMove` | `turn-flow-eligibility.ts` | `TurnFlowTransitionResult` (contains `.state: GameState` + trace entries + boundary durations) | Accept mutable state + tracker; still must return non-state fields (trace entries, boundary durations) |
| `applyBoundaryExpiry` | `boundary-expiry.ts` | `BoundaryExpiryResult` (contains `.state: GameState` + trace entries) | Accept mutable state + tracker; still must return non-state fields (trace entries) |
| `applyReleasedDeferredEventEffects` | `apply-move.ts` (internal) | `MoveActionExecutionResult` (contains `.stateWithRng: GameState`) | Accept mutable state + tracker; still must return non-state fields (trigger firings) |

**Important**: Functions called from OUTSIDE `applyMove` (e.g., `legalMoves`, `terminalResult`, agent preview) continue to receive immutable `GameState`. The mutable path is ONLY within `applyMoveCore`.

### 5. Hash Computation at Draft Boundary

`computeFullHash` (in `zobrist.ts`) returns a `bigint` hash value. Currently, `applyMoveCore` (lines 1517-1521) creates a final spread: `{ ...progressedState, stateHash: reconciledHash, _runningHash: reconciledHash }`. In the draft system:
1. Compute the hash from the mutable state via `reconcileRunningHash` or `computeFullHash` (read-only operation — safe)
2. Assign `mutableState.stateHash = reconciledHash` and `mutableState._runningHash = reconciledHash` directly
3. Then `freezeState(mutableState)` produces the final immutable state with the correct hash

### 6. Probe Path Isolation

`probeMoveViability` (at `apply-move.ts:1821`) is a pure read-only validation probe — it performs condition evaluation, parameter validation, and decision sequence resolution without any state mutation. It does NOT call `applyMoveCore` or `applyMove`. Therefore, it is **unaffected by this change** and requires no modification.

The key invariant remains: `applyMove` and `applyTrustedMove` both call `applyMoveCore`, which will own the single draft scope. `probeMoveViability` operates on immutable state and never enters the draft path.

## Constraints

1. **Foundation 8 (Determinism)**: Same seed + same actions = identical stateHash. The draft system MUST produce bit-identical state to the spread-based system. Verified by running all existing determinism tests and the perf campaign harness (which checks stateHash across runs).

2. **Foundation 11 (Immutability — external contract)**: The `applyMove` / `applyTrustedMove` public API continues to return an immutable `GameState`. Input state is never modified. Only internal working state is mutable.

3. **Foundation 16 (Testing as Proof)**: Add property-based tests that verify: (a) for a random sequence of effects, the draft-based and spread-based paths produce identical states; (b) the input state is never modified (deep-freeze the input, assert no throw during execution).

4. **No V8 Hidden Class Regression**: The DraftTracker extension (Deliverable 3) adds new fields to `DraftTracker`, not to `EffectCursor` or `GameDefRuntime`. DraftTracker is created once per applyMove scope and accessed only via explicit helper functions — it does not participate in V8 inline-cache-sensitive call sites. This is validated by the perf campaign harness (accept only if combined_duration_ms improves >1%).

## Risk Assessment

**High risk, high reward.** This change touches ~45-55 sites across 12+ kernel files. Incremental delivery is essential — convert one file at a time, verify determinism after each file.

**Suggested implementation order**:
1. Thread mutable state through `applyMoveCore` (top-level plumbing)
2. Ensure `effects-markers.ts` handlers always receive a tracker from the widened scope (they already have dual-path draft logic from Spec 78 — minimal conversion effort)
3. Convert `turn-flow-lifecycle.ts` (7 spread sites — largest uncovered file)
4. Convert `turn-flow-eligibility.ts` (4-6 spread sites)
5. Convert `apply-move.ts` lifecycle helpers and hash boundary (~10 spread sites)
6. Convert remaining files (`phase-advance.ts`, `action-usage.ts`, `effects-turn-flow.ts`, `effects-reveal.ts`, etc.)
7. Benchmark after each phase

## Expected Impact

- **Target**: 8-12% reduction in `combined_duration_ms` (eliminating ~12% CPU from object allocation/copying, minus overhead from COW tracking)
- **Measurement**: `fitl-perf-optimization` campaign harness (3 seeds × 3 runs, median)
- **Validation**: all existing tests pass + stateHash determinism preserved

## Outcome

**Completed**: 2026-04-14

- Landed the full draft-state rollout across archived tickets `128FULSCODRA-001` through `128FULSCODRA-006`, including widened `DraftTracker` coverage, full `applyMoveCore` draft ownership, lifecycle mutable-path threading, and the determinism / immutability proof lanes required by the spec.
- The original measurement gate in archived ticket `128FULSCODRA-007` first recorded a slower historical result (`15152.90ms` against the preserved campaign row `13755.39ms`), which left the series blocked pending investigation.
- Archived ticket `128FULSCODRA-008` then reran the authoritative FITL harness in isolated same-environment worktrees and established the decisive live comparison:
  - pre-128 `eab78a45`: `13887.36ms`
  - current `HEAD` `b33b7b44`: `13849.72ms`
- That same-environment comparison put current `HEAD` at `-0.27%` relative to the pre-128 point, so no live post-128 regression remained on the branch by the end of the series.
- The reconciled measurement was recorded in `campaigns/fitl-perf-optimization/results.tsv` as `exp-009`.

### Deviations From Original Plan

- The spec’s hoped-for direct 8-12% wall-clock win was not validated as a clean standalone series outcome. The live branch ultimately closed on “no worse than pre-128 in the same environment” rather than on proving a large isolated speedup against the older preserved campaign baseline row.
- The series needed a second measurement-reconciliation stage after later Spec 131 work changed the live benchmark context. That meant the final closeout relied on same-environment pre-128 reruns rather than the original historical baseline alone.
