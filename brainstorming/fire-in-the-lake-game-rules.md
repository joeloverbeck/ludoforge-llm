# Fire in the Lake Game Rules

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION
Fire in the Lake is a 1- to 4-player board game depicting insurgent
and counterinsurgent (COIN) conflict during the main US period
in Vietnam, 1964-1972, up to the “Paris Peace”. Each player takes
the role of a Faction seeking to set the fate of South Vietnam: the
United States (US), North Vietnamese forces (NVA), the Republic
of Vietnam forces (ARVN), or the southern communist Viet Cong
(VC). Using military, political, and economic actions and exploiting various events, players build and maneuver forces to influence
or control the population, extract resources, or otherwise achieve
their Faction’s aims. A deck of cards regulates turn order, events,
victory checks, and other processes. The rules can run non-player
Factions, enabling solitaire, 2-player, or multi-player games.
Fire in the Lake is Volume IV in the COIN Series of games that
use similar rules to cover modern Insurgencies. The Playbook lists
major rules differences from earlier volumes.
Game set up is explained on pages 23-24 of this rule book. An
index on pages 21-22 lists and defines key game terms. Sequences
and options for player and non-player actions are summarized on
several aid sheets.
1.1 General Course of Play
Fire in the Lake—unlike many card-assisted war games—does not
use hands of cards. Instead, cards are played from the deck one
at time, with one card ahead revealed to all players. Each Event
card shows the order in which the Factions become Eligible to
choose between the card’s Event or one of a menu of Operations
and Special Activities. Executing an Event or Operation carries
the penalty of rendering that Faction Ineligible to do so on the next
card. Coup cards mixed in with the Event cards provide periodic
opportunities for instant wins and for activities such as collecting
resources and influencing popular sympathies.
1.2 Components
A complete set of Fire in the Lake includes:
• A 22”x34” mounted game board (1.3).
• A deck of 130 cards (5.0).
• 229 olive, bright blue, red, yellow, and orange wooden playing
pieces, many embossed (1.4; see “Forces Pool” on the Spaces
List sheet for a complete listing).
• 7 embossed cylinders (1.8, 2.2).
• 6 black and 6 white pawns (3.1.1).
• A sheet of markers.
• 2 Sequence of Play and Spaces List sheets (1.4.1, 2.0, 6.0).
• 4 Faction player aid foldouts (3.0, 4.0, 7.0).
• A Random Spaces and Non-player Events foldout (8.2, 8.4).
• 2 Non-player Operations foldouts (8.5-8.8).
• 3 6-sided dice—1 blue, 1 red, 1 yellow.
• A background play book.
• This rule book.
1.3 The Map
The map shows South Vietnam and nearby areas divided into various
types of spaces.
1.3.1 Map Spaces. Map spaces include rural Provinces, Cities, and
Lines of Communication (LoCs) that are either Highways or the
Mekong river. All spaces—including LoCs—can hold forces. Towns
are not spaces, merely boundaries between adjacent LoCs (1.3.6)
1.3.2 Provinces. Each Province shows a Population value (Pop) of
0, 1, or 2 that affects victory via Support for or Opposition to the
Saigon regime (1.6) or Control (1.7) and some Insurgent actions.
Provinces are further distinguished as Highland, Lowland, or Jungle,
affecting Counterinsurgent Sweeps (3.2.3), Assaults (3.2.4), and
certain Events (5.0). 

1.3.3 Cities. Cities similarly show Population value of 1, 2, or 6.
DESIGN NOTE: Each Population value represents about 500,000
citizens of South Vietnam.
1.3.4 LoCs. Each Line of Communication (LoC) space is either
Highway (road) or Mekong (river) or both and shows an Economic
value (Econ) of 0, 1, or 2 affecting ARVN Resource earnings (1.8,
6.2.3) and Viet Cong Taxation (4.5.1). NOTE: LoCs are spaces!
1.3.5 Foreign Countries. The map’s Provinces include parts of
North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. All other spaces are South
Vietnam (“The South”). Only NVA and VC may stack in North
Vietnam (1.4.2). US and ARVN may enter Laos or Cambodia spaces
normally, but at risk of later removal (6.4.1).
1.3.6 Adjacency. Adjacency affects the movement of forces and
implementation of certain Events. Any 2 spaces meeting one of the
following conditions are adjacent:
• Spaces that border on (touch) one another.
• Provinces that would touch but for separation by a LoC.
• LoCs or Provinces separated by Towns.
NOTE: Towns are not spaces; they merely terminate LoCs (1.3.1).
ADJACENCY EXAMPLE: Quang Duc Province and Route 11 are
adjacent via Da Lat, as are Quang Duc and Khanh Hoa across
Route 21.
1.3.7 Coasts. Any spaces adjacent to blue ocean (including across
a LoC) are coastal, affecting the Amphibious Landing, Operation
Starlite, and USS New Jersey Events (5.0).
1.3.8 Overflow. Use “Overflow” boxes for
pieces that exceed the room in a space on the
map; place the lettered marker in that space.
1.4 Forces
The wooden pieces represent the Factions’ various forces: US Troops
(olive cubes), ARVN Troops (yellow cubes) and Police (orange
cubes), NVA Troops (red cubes), NVA and VC Guerrillas, US and
ARVN Special Forces (SF), and all Factions’ Bases.
DESIGN NOTE: ARVN Police represent both urban police and
rural militias such as Regional Forces and Popular Forces. US-led
Irregulars include both CIDG counter-guerrillas and US special
operations forces training them or operating on their own. Bases
represent command, training, and supply facilities as well as political administration.
1.4.1 Availability, Removal, and Out of Play. A “Force Pool” inventory on the Spaces List sheet shows the number of pieces in the
game. Keep forces Available for placement in the Faction’s Available
Forces box (or the US-led Irregulars box). Place NVA and VC Bases
in the highest- and US Bases and Troops in the lowest-numbered
empty spaces to show the number of on-map Bases and Available
US Bases and Troops to help track earnings (6.2) and victory (7.0).
US and ARVN may have forces in the Out of Play box—neither
Available nor on the map—and US forces can become Casualties
(3.3.3, 4.4.2, 5.0, 6.5). Otherwise, forces removed from the map
go to Available.
• Unless otherwise instructed (by Event, 5.1.1), forces may only be
placed from or replaced with those in the Available boxes. A piece
to be replaced by a piece that is unavailable is simply removed
(EXCEPTION: Infiltrate, 4.4.1).
•	 Important: Players while executing an Operation, Special Activity, or Event to place their own forces may take them from
elsewhere on the map (including a Tunneled Base, losing the
Tunnel marker, 1.4.4) if and only if the desired force type is not
Available. EXCEPTION: The US player may do so only with
US-led Irregulars and any ARVN forces, not with US Troops nor
with US Bases.
EXAMPLES: NVA without Available Guerrillas could remove its
own during a Rally (3.3.1) to place them Underground. US Train
could take Police from another space if none Available.
1.4.2 Stacking. No more than 2 Bases (of any Factions) may occupy
a single Province or City. Bases may not occupy LoCs. Only NVA
and VC forces may occupy North Vietnam (1.3.5).
• Placing (such as Bases via Train 3.2.1, Rally 3.3.1, Event 5.1.1, or
Commitment 6.5) or moving forces may never violate stacking.
1.4.3 Underground/Active. Guerrillas and Special Forces are
either Underground—symbol end down—or Active—symbol end
up. Actions and Events flip them from one to the other state. Bases,
Troops, and Police are always Active. Always set up and place new Guerrillas and SF Underground (including if replacing a piece).
NOTE: Unless instructions specify “Underground” Guerrilla, it is
sufficient to “Activate” already Active Guerrillas (they stay Active).
Also, “moving” or “relocating” Guerrillas or SF does not affect
Underground status unless specified.
1.4.4 Tunnels. Scenario Setup (2.1) and
Events (5.0) designate certain VC or NVA
Bases as Tunneled. Place an appropriate
Tunnel marker on such a Base, never
more than 1 Tunnel marker at a time per Base. Tunneled Bases are
harder to remove by Operations or Events (3.2.4, 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 4.3.3,
5.1.1). When a Tunneled Base is removed, so is the Tunnel marker.
NVA can Infiltrate a VC Tunneled Base to make it NVA (4.4.1).
1.5 Players & Factions
The game may have up to 4 players, each as 1 or more Factions:
the US (olive), the NVA (red), the ARVN (yellow and orange), or
the VC (blue). In a 1-player game, the player plays US and ARVN
together, or NVA and VC, or any 1 Faction (8.9). Leftover Factions
are controlled either by rules section 8 as “Non-Players” or, if preferred with 2 or 3 players, as below.
No Non-Player Option: With 2 or 3 players, the players
(rather than the Non-Player rules, 8.0) may control any leftover
Factions:
• With 2 players, 1 player controls NVA and VC, the other US
and ARVN.
• With 3 players, a single player controls NVA and VC or, if
preferred, US and ARVN.
POLITBURO: A combined NVA/VC player uses the higher
victory margin of the 2 Factions during Coup Rounds (winning
if either meets its condition, 6.1, 7.2), but uses the lower of the
2 after Final Coup (7.3). A combined NVA/VC player may not
transfer Resources (1.5.2).
SOVEREIGNTY: A US/ARVN player uses the lower victory
margin of the 2 Factions (7.3) and only causes play to end on
a victory check (6.1, 7.2) if both are meeting their conditions.
DESIGN NOTE: NVA, VC, and ARVN pieces draw their colors as
much as possible from their respective flags, US from the olive GI
uniform.
1.5.1 Friends and Enemies. US and ARVN are Counterinsurgent
(COIN) Factions and friendly to each other; NVA and VC are Insurgents and friendly to each other. Counterinsurgents are enemy
to Insurgents.
1.5.2 Negotiation. Players may make any mutual arrangements
within the rules. All negotiations are open. The rules do not bind
players to agreements.
• The NVA and VC if separate players may voluntarily transfer
Resources (1.8) to each other at any time that one of them is
executing an Operation, Special Activity, or Event.
1.6 Support and Opposition
Support and Opposition affect victory and some operations and
activities.
1.6.1 Cities and Provinces with at least 1 Population (1.3.2-3) always
show 1 of 5 levels of its populace’s Support for or Opposition to the
Saigon regime that can shift during play:
• Active Support.
• Passive Support.
• Neutral.
• Passive Opposition.
• Active Opposition.
1.6.2 Active Support or Opposition counts double Population for
Total Support or Opposition—affecting US or VC victory (7.2-.3).
Show Support or Opposition with markers placed in each City or
Province. Show Neutral spaces by the absence of such markers.

Neutral

Total Support =
2 x Pop in Active Support + 1 x Pop in Passive Support
Total Opposition =
2 x Pop in Active Opposition + 1 x Pop in Passive Oppostion
NOTE: LoCs (1.3.4) and Pop 0 Provinces are always Neutral, never
at Support or Opposition.
1.7 Control
The 2 Counterinsurgent Factions together
(US and ARVN) Control a Province or City
if their pieces there combined exceed those
of the other 2 Factions (NVA and VC) combined. The NVA alone Control a Province or City if NVA pieces
exceed all other pieces (including VC). Control affects certain activities and victory. Adjust COIN Control and NVA Control markers
as Control changes due to placement, removal, or movement of
pieces.
1.8 Resources, Aid, and Patronage
At any moment, each Faction except the US has between 0 and 75
Resources that it uses to pay for Operations (3.0). During Coup
Rounds (6.2.3), a level of Aid (between 0 and 75) is added to ARVN
Resources. A level of Patronage (0 to 75) contributes to ARVN
victory (7.0). Mark Resources, Aid, and Patronage on the edge
track—for Resources, with a cylinder of that Faction’s color (1.5).
DESIGN NOTE: Patronage represents the wherewithal of the Saigon
regime to reward its friends at the expense of the population, such
as by diverting foreign aid—a means of governance that the US
could view as corrupt.
1.8.1 Joint Operations. The US does not track its own
Resources. Some US Operations (3.1) and US Pacification (3.2.1, 6.3.1) spend ARVN Resources. The US
may only spend those ARVN Resources that exceed
the marked Total Econ level (1.3.4, 6.2.3). Only the ARVN Faction
may spend ARVN Resources at or below Econ.

1.9 Victory Markers
Similarly track with markers on the edge track the following totals
that affect victory (7.0).
• Total Support (1.6.2) plus the number of US Troops and Bases
Available (1.4.1).
• Total Population Controlled by the NVA plus the number of NVA
Bases on the map (1.7).
• Total Population Controlled by the COIN Factions (1.7) plus
Patronage (1.8).
• Total Opposition (1.6.2) plus the number of VC Bases on the map.
NOTE: A marker on “The Trail” track records the efficiency level of
the NVA’s North-to-South supply network (6.7). Twelve “Deception”
markers are for victory-related optional rules (7.3).
2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
2.1 Set Up
Follow the instructions on the last 2 pages of this rule book to choose
a scenario and various play options, assign Factions to players,
prepare the draw deck, and set up markers and forces.
2.2 Start
Begin play by revealing the top card of the draw deck and placing
it onto a played cards pile. Then reveal the next card on top of the
draw deck. The card on the played card stack is played first; the card
on top of the draw deck will be played next. NOTE: Players will see
1 card ahead into the deck (2.3.7). All played cards and the number
of cards in the draw deck are open to inspection.
RECORD STEPS: As the steps of each Event card play are completed, place a cylinder of the Faction’s color (1.5) into the Sequence
of Play track’s appropriate box (or, for Coup Rounds [6.0], advance
the Coup Card marker).
2.3 Event Card
When playing an Event card, up to 2 Factions will execute Operations or the Event.
• Factions whose cylinder is in the “Eligible” box receive these
options in the left-to-right order of Faction symbols shown at top
of the card.
• Factions with cylinders in the “Ineligible” box do nothing.
2.3.1 Eligibility. Factions that did not execute an Operation or Event
on the previous card are Eligible (their cylinders will start the card
in the “Eligible” box per 2.3.6). Factions that did are Ineligible. (All
Factions start the game Eligible.) See also Free Operations, 3.1.2.
2.3.2 Faction Order. The Eligible Faction with the leftmost symbol
in its color (skipping any Ineligible Factions) is the 1st Eligible to
execute an Operation or Event or to Pass. The next leftmost is the
2nd Eligible. NOTE: Light halos around some Faction symbols
relate only to Non player instructions (8.4.1).
2.3.3 Passing. If a 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction (only!) opts to Pass,
it remains Eligible for the next card and receives +1 Resource if
an Insurgent Faction or adds +3 ARVN Resources if either COIN
Faction. The next leftmost Eligible Faction then replaces the Passing
Faction as the new 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction and receives the same
options to execute or Pass. If the last (rightmost) Eligible Faction
Passes, adjust cylinders (2.3.7) and play the next card.
2.3.4 Options for Eligible Factions.
FIRST ELIGIBLE: If the 1st Eligible Faction does not Pass (2.3.3),
it may execute either:
• An Operation (3.0)—with or without a Special Activity (4.0)—or
• The Event shown on the card.
OPTIONS FOR 2ND ELIGIBLE: If the 2nd Eligible Faction does
not Pass (2.3.3), it also may execute an Operation or possibly the
Event, but its options depend on what the 1st Eligible Faction
executed:
• Op Only: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an Operation, the
2nd Eligible Faction may execute a Limited Operation (2.3.5).
• Op & Special Activity: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an
Operation with a Special Activity, the 2nd Eligible Faction may
execute a Limited Operation or instead execute the Event.
• Event: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed the Event, the 2nd Eligible Faction may execute an Operation, with a Special Activity
if desired.
NOTE: The game board and Sequence of Play aid sheet also show
these options.
2.3.5 Limited Operation. A Limited Operation is an Operation in
just 1 space, with no Special Activity. If the Limited Operation is a
Patrol (3.2.2), Sweep (3.2.3), or March (3.3.2), it can involve pieces
from multiple spaces but only 1 destination space. A Limited Operation counts as an Operation. (See also Non-player Operations, 8.1).
2.3.6 Adjust Eligibility. After the 1st and 2nd Eligible Factions
complete all execution of Operations, Special Activities, and Events
(or after all Eligible Factions instead have Passed), adjust cylinders
on the Sequence of Play track as follows:
• Any Faction that did not execute an Operation or Event (and was
not rendered Ineligible by an Event) to the “Eligible” box.
• Any Faction that executed an Operation (including a Limited
Operation) or Event to the “Ineligible” box (unless otherwise
specified by the Event; see also Free Operations, 3.1.2).
PLAY NOTE: Some Events (5.0) will enable the executing Faction
to remain Eligible or render other Factions Ineligible through the
next card. As a reminder, mark a Faction thus remaining Eligible by
placing its cylinder at the left edge of its Sequence of Play “Event”
box. Mark a Faction thus rendered Ineligible by placing its cylinder
with (under) the executing Faction’s, to show that it will be Ineligible
for the next card.
2.3.7 Next Card. After adjusting Eligibility, move the draw deck’s
top card onto the played card pile face-up and reveal the draw deck’s
next card (even if the played card is Coup!, 2.4). Play the played
card, proceeding with the appropriate sequence.
2.3.8 Pivotal Events. Each Faction begins the Medium and Full
scenarios (only, 2.1) with a Pivotal Event card unique to it. Pivotal
Events are a type of Event (5.0). A Faction may play its Pivotal
Event to cancel a currently played Event card (including Eligibility
order, 2.3) if:
• That Faction is Eligible, AND
• The red pre-condition on the card is met, AND
• The 1st Eligible Faction has not yet done anything, AND
• No Coup is showing as the next card (2.3.9).
PROCEDURE: The Faction interrupts the usual Sequence of Play
by placing its Pivotal Event card on the played Event card and executing the Pivotal Event. The new Eligibility sequence follows, and
the Pivotal Event stays in the played card pile, as normal.
TRUMPING PIVOTAL EVENTS: The VC may play its Pivotal
Event on top of another Faction’s Pivotal Event, canceling it;
ARVN may do so to US or NVA; NVA may do so to US; US may
not do so. A canceled Pivotal Event card is returned to its owner
for possible later use.
PLAY NOTES: The 1st Eligible Faction need not declare what it
would execute before a Faction must decide whether to play its
Pivotal Event. Place “Playable Pivotal Event” reminder markers
on unplayed Pivotal Event cards for which preconditions are met.
2.3.9 Monsoon Season. On the last Event card before each Coup
Card (2.4), Operations may not include Sweep (3.2.3, even via
Advise, 4.2.1) nor March (3.3.2), US Air Strikes and Air Lifts are
limited to 2 spaces (4.2.2-.3), and no Pivotal Events allowed (2.3.8).
(But see 5.1.1 regarding Event text.)
NOTE: Keep the “Monsoon” marker near the deck and place it on
the played Event card as a reminder while a Coup is showing as
the next card.
2.4 Coup Card
If playing a Coup Card, first carry out any immediate instructions on
the card. Then place the card in the box marked “RVN Leader” (see
below). Finally, conduct a Coup Round (6.0), marking each phase
on the Sequence of Play with the “Coup Card” marker.
2.4.1 RVN Leader. The top (most recently played) Coup card (or
the “RVN Leader” box, if empty) shows the current Republic of
Vietnam (RVN) Leader. Any lingering effects noted for that Leader
are in effect, as if it is the text of a lingering executed Event (5.1,
5.3, 5.4). If the most recently played card is “Failed Attempt”, place
it underneath any previous Coup cards. NOTE: “Failed Attempts”
cancel only “Duong Van Minh”. Minh is an RVN Leader but not
a card. Minh thus does not count as a card in the RVN Leader box
(such as for Pivotal Event pre-conditions, 2.3.8). “Nguyen Cao Ky”
will affect Pacification beginning with that Coup Round (6.3.1).
2.4.2 Final Coup. If the last Coup card’s Round is completed without
a victory (6.1), the game ends: determine victory by 7.3.
NOTE: Each series of Event cards up to a Coup is a “Campaign”,
representing 1-2 years of war.
3.0 OPERATIONS
3.1 Operations in General
A Faction executing an Operation (Op) chooses 1 of the 4 Operations listed on its Faction sheet and selects the map spaces (typically
several) to be involved. Select a given space only once for a given
Operation.
Operations usually cost Resources (not Aid or Patronage,1.8), often per
space selected; the paying Faction must have enough Resources to pay
for the Operation, including in each selected space. The US does not
spend Resources of its own; it sometimes spends ARVN Resources,
but may not do so below the marked Total Econ (1.8.1, 6.2.3).
The executing Faction chooses the order of the spaces in which
the Operation is resolved, the enemy Factions (1.5) or pieces to be
affected (targeted), and the friendly pieces to be placed, replaced,
or moved. An Operation may target both enemies or just one and
ignore the other. NOTE: Allied forces nevertheless protect the Bases
of the other friendly Faction from Assault/Attack (3.2.4, 3.3.3). Once
targeted, a Faction’s pieces are affected to the maximum extent possible. Actions affecting another Faction’s pieces, friendly or enemy,
do not require that Faction’s permission.
3.1.1 Pawns. If desired, mark spaces selected for Operations (3.0),
Special Activities (4.0), or other actions with white and black pawns.
The pawns are for convenience, not a limit on play.
3.1.2 Free Operations. Certain Events (5.5) grant free Operations
or Special Activities: they cost no Resources and, if executed by a
Faction other than the one playing an Event, do not affect its Eligibility (2.3.6). EXCEPTIONS: Pacification, Agitation, and Trail
Improvement still cost Resources even if part of a free Operation
(3.2.1, 3.3.1). Other requirements and procedures still apply unless
modified by Event text (5.1.1, 5.5.).
3.2 COIN Operations
The US and ARVN choose from Train, Patrol, Sweep,
and Assault Operations. NOTE: These Factions never
place or move pieces into North Vietnam (1.4.2).
3.2.1 Train. Training adds ARVN forces and can build Support (1.6)
or drop Patronage (1.8). NOTE: The US gets its Troops and Bases
in and out of Vietnam via the Commitment Phase (6.5) and Events
(5.0), not Operations.
• ARVN may select any Provinces or Cities without NVA Control.
• The US may select any Provinces or Cities that have US pieces.
• Either Faction spends 3 ARVN Resources only if it places any
ARVN pieces (including replacing cubes with a Base).
PROCEDURE: First, in those selected spaces desired, if US, place
1-2 Irregulars or, at US Bases, 1-2 Rangers or up to 6 ARVN cubes
(any combination of Troops and Police); if ARVN, place 1-2 Rangers or up to 6 ARVN cubes at Cities or at US or ARVN Bases. If
none of the desired ARVN pieces are Available (1.4.1), they may
be taken from the map. Then, in 1 selected space (even if a Limited
Operation, 2.3.5), if desired either:
• Pacify to remove any Terror marker and then to shift the space
up to 2 levels toward Active Support. The space must have COIN
Control and, if ARVN Training, both ARVN Troops and Police.
(Unlike Pacification during the Support Phase, 6.3.1, the US does
not need Troops and Police, only a US piece and COIN Control.)
The Pacification costs 3 ARVN Resources per Terror marker
removed and level shifted, even if the Training Operation was
free (3.1.2, 5.5). OR
• If ARVN, replace any 3 ARVN cubes with 1 ARVN Base (within
stacking,1.4.2). NOTE: Replacing cubes with a Base costs 3 ARVN
Resources even if no cubes were placed. OR
• If US and the space is Saigon, transfer up to 3 Patronage to ARVN
Resources.
3.2.2 Patrol. Patrolling protects LoCs by moving Troops or Police
onto them and finding and removing Insurgents there. If ARVN,
pay 3 Resources total (not per space); if US, the cost is 0. If a
Limited Operation (2.3.5), all moving cubes must end on a single destination space. 

PROCEDURE: Move any number of your Faction’s cubes from
any spaces. Each cube may move into any adjacent LoC or City
and may keep entering adjacent LoCs or Cities until the player
chooses to stop moving it or it enters a space with any NVA or VC
piece. Then, in each LoC (whether or not a cube just moved there),
Activate 1 enemy Guerrilla for each of your Faction’s cubes there.
Then, if desired, Assault (3.2.4) in 1 LoC at no added cost. US may
not add ARVN. If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), the Assault must be
in the destination LoC.
3.2.3 Sweep. Sweeps may move Troops and can locate enemy Guerrillas. Select Provinces or Cities as destinations (not North Vietnam,
1.4.2). If ARVN, pay 3 Resources per space selected; if US, 0. Sweep
is not allowed in Monsoon (a Coup card showing as next, 2.3.9).
PROCEDURE: First, move any of your Faction’s adjacent Troops
desired into selected spaces. In addition, each group of Troops may
first move onto an adjacent LoC (1.3.3) that is free of NVA/VC
and then into an adjacent space. (Any Troops that move must reach
spaces paid for as destinations.)
• Then, in each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) 1 enemy Guerrilla
for each of your cubes (moved or already there) or Special Forces
(Irregulars for US, Rangers for ARVN).
• In Jungle spaces, Activate only 1 enemy Guerrilla for every 2 of
your cubes or Special Forces (round odd totals down).
SWEEP EXAMPLE: ARVN selects Quang Duc for a Sweep. No LoCs
have Guerrillas. Two Troops move from Cam Ranh onto Route 11
and from there via Da Lat into Quang Duc Province. ARVN Troops
in Binh Tuy – Binh Thuan also could enter Quang Duc.
3.2.4 Assault. Assaults remove enemy pieces. Select any spaces with
the executing Faction’s cubes and Insurgents (NVA or VC). ARVN
pay 3 Resources per space. US Assault costs 3 ARVN Resources only
if the US player opts to add an ARVN Assault in 1 US Assault space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, remove enemy pieces per
the number of cubes there, as follows.
• If an ARVN Assault, count only ARVN cubes. Remove 1 enemy
piece for every 2 cubes there or every 3 in Highland (round down).
In Cities or on LoCs, count Police as well as Troops; in Provinces,
Troops only. For each Base removed (including via follow up to
US Assault, below, or Advise, 4.2.1), add +6 Aid.
• If a US Assault, count US Troops. Remove 2 enemies per US
Troops cube if the space has a US Base, or only 1 enemy for
every 2 US Troops (round down) if Highland with no US Base,
or otherwise 1 enemy piece for each US Troop. If desired, pay
3 ARVN Resources to follow up with an ARVN Assault per the
above bullet in 1 space where US Assault just occurred (no effect
on ARVN Eligibility, 2.3.1).
TROOPS FIRST, BASES LAST: Remove any NVA Troops in an
Assault space first, then any Active NVA or VC Guerrillas (Assaulting Faction chooses which first), then any Insurgent Bases only
once no NVA nor VC Guerrillas remain. Remove no Underground
Guerrillas (1.4.3).
NOTE: Underground Guerrillas in a space prevent further removal
via Assault of Bases until the Guerrillas are Activated. Also, nonBase pieces protect the Bases of the other friendly Faction from
Assault/Attack (3.3.3).
DESIGN NOTE: Guerrillas are less hard hitting than Troops but
enjoy an information advantage in that counterinsurgents must
Activate (locate) them before Assaulting them.
TUNNELS: If the next piece to be removed would be a Base with a
Tunnel marker (1.4.4), stop removing pieces from that space. Instead,
roll a die: on a 1-3, do nothing further; on a 4-6, remove that Tunnel
marker only (leave the Base in place). EXAMPLE: Three US Troops
Assault 2 Tunneled Bases alone in Jungle. No pieces are removed.
On a roll of 4-6, a Tunnel marker is removed from one Base.
3.3 Insurgent Operations
The NVA and VC choose from Rally, March, Attack, or
Terror Operations.
3.3.1 Rally. Rally Operations augment friendly forces, recover VC,
and build the Trail. Select any Provinces or Cities without Support
(1.6). Pay 1 Resource per space selected.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, the executing Faction places
1 of its Available Guerrillas or replaces 2 of its Guerrillas with 1 of
its Bases (within stacking 1.4.2). If the space already has at least 1
of that Faction’s Bases, the Faction may instead:
• If NVA, place a number of its Guerrillas up to the sum of Trail
value (6.7) plus the number of NVA Bases there.
• If VC, place its Guerrillas up to the sum of the space’s Population
value (1.3.2-.3) plus the number of VC Bases there OR flip all its
Guerrillas there Underground (1.4.3). NOTE: VC may Agitate as
well if it has the shaded “Cadres” Capability (5.3); that Agitation
costs Resources even if the Rally was free (3.1.2, 5.5).
Then, NVA with its Rally may spend another 2 Resources to Improve
the Trail by 1 box (6.7, even if the Rally was a Limited Operation,
2.3.5, or selected 0 spaces). Rally to Improve the Trail costs 2 even
if the Rally was free (3.1.2, 5.5).
3.3.2 March. March Operations move Insurgent Guerrillas and
Troops. Moving pieces may begin in any spaces. Pay 1 Resource
per Province or City that Guerrillas or Troops move into (0 Resources to move onto LoCs). A Limited Operation (2.3.5) March
may select only a single destination space. March is not allowed in
Monsoon (2.3.9).
PROCEDURE: The executing Faction moves any of its Guerrillas
or Troops desired into adjacent spaces (1.3.6). Pieces moving from 1
space to another move as a single group. Set Guerrillas of a moving
group to Active (1.4.3) if:
• The destination is a LoC or has any Support (1.6) AND
• The moving group’s number of pieces plus the number of US and
ARVN cubes, Irregulars, and Rangers at the destination exceeds 3.
EXAMPLE: Two Underground VC Guerrillas March from The
Parrot’s Beak into Kien Phong, where there are 2 Police cubes and
Support. The total of 4 relevant pieces at the destination exceeds 3,
so the VC Guerrillas flip to Active.
THE TRAIL: Marching NVA Guerrillas and Troops (not VC) may
continue moving into additional spaces (paying once only for each
added destination) if the previous destination space was in Laos or
Cambodia (1.3.5), the Trail value is above 0 (6.7), and the March is
not a LimOp (2.3.5). Also, if the Trail value is 4, NVA March into
or out of individual Laos or Cambodia spaces costs 0 Resources.
NOTE: COIN Control does not stop such moves (1.7).
3.3.3 Attack. Attack Operations seek to eliminate enemy forces.
Select any spaces where the executing Faction and an enemy have
pieces; pay 1 Resource per space.

PROCEDURE: In each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) all the
executing Faction’s Guerrillas and then roll a die: if the roll is less
than or equal to the number of the executing Faction’s Guerrillas
there (whether or not they began Active), remove up to 2 enemy
pieces (executing Faction’s choice). The NVA may instead remove
1 enemy piece per 2 NVA Troops there (round down, Activate no
Guerrillas). Removed pieces may belong to different Factions and
may be Underground Special Forces.
• Do not remove US or ARVN Bases before any other pieces of
either Faction in the space.
CASUALTIES: Place any US pieces removed by Attack into the
Casualties box.
ATTRITION: For each US Troop cube or US Base removed, the
Attacking Faction must remove 1 of its Attacking pieces (Troops
or Guerrillas, whichever used) from the space.
3.3.4 Terror. Terror Operations in Cities or Provinces affect Support and Opposition (1.6) and
place Terror markers that hinder future efforts to
influence it. On LoCs, they place Sabotage markers that block ARVN
Resource earnings (6.2.1). Select any spaces where the executing
Faction has at least 1 Underground Guerrilla or, for NVA Terror, NVA
Troop cube; pay 1 Resource per Province or City (0 for LoCs).
PROCEDURE: Activate 1 friendly Underground Guerrilla in each
selected space (if any there).
• If the space is a Province or City without a Terror marker, place
a Terror marker. If VC, shift 1 level toward Active Opposition
(1.6). If NVA, shift any Support 1 level toward Neutral.
• If the space is a LoC without a Sabotage marker, place a Sabotage
marker.
• Do not place a Terror/Sabotage marker if all are already on the
map. (There are 15.)
NOTE: Terror Ops will not add Terror or Sabotage markers to
spaces that already have them. (Certain events can do so, 5.1.1).
4.0 SPECIAL ACTIVITIES
4.1 Special Activities in General
When a Faction per the Event Card sequence of play (2.3) executes
an Operation (3.0), it may also execute 1 type of its Special Activities (EXCEPTION: Limited Operations, 2.3.5). There is no added
Resource cost for the Special Activity. As with Operations, the
executing Faction selects spaces, Factions, or pieces affected and
the order of actions. Select a given space only once as a location
for a given Special Activity. (But see removal of adjacent pieces
via Ambush from Road/River locations, 4.4.3). Events may grant
free Special Activities (not further affecting Eligibility, 3.1.2, 5.5).
•	 Important: A Faction may execute its Special Activity at any one
time immediately before, during, or immediately after its Operation.
EXAMPLE: The VC Rally until at 0 Resources, then pause to Tax
and gain Resources, then continue to Rally in added spaces.
PLAY NOTE: If the 1st Eligible Faction uses a Special Activity, the
2nd Eligible receives the option of executing the card’s Event, and
vice versa (2.3.4).
4.1.1. Accompanying Operations. Some Special Activities specify
that they may only accompany certain types of Operations (3.0).
Certain Special Activities either must occur or may not occur where
their Accompanying Operations occurred. If not otherwise specified,
Special Activities may accompany any Operations and take place
in any otherwise valid spaces.
4.2 US Special Activities
The US may choose from Advise, Air Lift, or Air Strike
Special Activities.
4.2.1 Advise. Advise strikes with indigenous allied forces and can
add to Aid (1.8). It may only accompany Training or Patrol (3.2.1-
.2) and take place in 1 or 2 spaces NOT selected for Training (never
North Vietnam, 1.4.2).
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, either:
• Sweep within the space with ARVN forces as if an ARVN Sweep
there without movement (3.2.3, not in Monsoon, 2.3.9), OR
• Assault there as if ARVN Assault (3.2.4), OR
• Activate 1 Underground Irregular or Ranger there to remove 2
enemy pieces. Bases may only be removed once no other enemy
pieces are there. Tunneled Bases (1.4.4) may not be removed
(Underground Guerrillas may).
Then, if desired, add +6 Aid total (to max of 75).
4.2.2 Air Lift. Air Lift moves Troops, especially to mass them
quickly for an Operation.
PROCEDURE: Move any US Troops and up to 4 ARVN Troops,
Rangers, or Irregulars among any 4 spaces (2 spaces during Monsoon, 2.3.9; not North Vietnam, 1.4.2).
4.2.3 Air Strike. Air Strike destroys exposed Insurgent units. It may
take place in up to 6 spaces (2 spaces during Monsoon, 2.3.9), each
with any US or ARVN piece in it.
PROCEDURE: Remove a total of up to 6 Active enemy pieces
(6 pieces even during Monsoon) from among the selected spaces.
Remove Bases only from spaces where no other Insurgent pieces
remain. Remove no Underground Guerrillas nor Tunneled Bases.
Shift each space selected 1 level toward Active Opposition (if a
Province or City with at least 1 Population, 1.6.1). Then, if desired,
Degrade the Trail by 1 box (6.7), even if 0 pieces removed.
4.3 ARVN Special Activities
The ARVN chooses from Govern, Transport, or Raid Special
Activities.
4.3.1 Govern. Governing adds Aid or extracts Patronage from Aid
and Support. It may only accompany Training or Patrol (3.2.1-.2)
and take place in 1 or 2 COIN-Controlled Provinces or Cities (1.7)
with any level of Support (1.6) NOT Saigon NOR selected for
Training. NOTE: ARVN may Train and Govern but not in the same
space during the same Op.
PROCEDURE: In each space, either:
• Add 3 times the space’s Population to Aid (to a maximum of 75),
OR
• Transfer its Population value (times 1) from Aid to Patronage
(max 75) and shift the space 1 level toward Neutral. There must
be more ARVN cubes (Troops and Police total) than US cubes
(Troops) in the space.
DESIGN NOTE: South Vietnamese officials may Govern benignly
to attract more foreign aid, or less benignly to divert more aid to 4.3.2 Transport. Transport moves Troops and Rangers, to take
control of countryside, for example, and prepares Rangers for Raids.
PROCEDURE: Select 1 space and move up to 6 ARVN Troops and/
or Rangers from there onto 1 or more adjacent LoCs, if desired.
They may continue to move along adjacent LoCs or through Cities
and then, if desired, into any adjacent destinations (not North Vietnam, 1.4.2). They must stop at any NVA or VC pieces. Then flip all
Rangers anywhere on the map to Underground.
4.3.3 Raid. Raiding repositions and strikes with the ARVN’s special
forces—Rangers. It may only accompany Patrol, Sweep, or Assault
(3.2.2-.4) and take place in 1 or 2 spaces.
PROCEDURE: Each selected space, move in any adjacent Rangers desired (keeping them either Underground or Active). Then, if
desired, Activate an Underground Ranger in each space to remove
2 enemy pieces. Bases may only be removed once no other enemy
pieces are there. Tunneled Bases (1.4.4) may not be removed (Underground Guerrillas may).
4.4 NVA Special Activities
The NVA choose from Infiltrate, Bombard, or Ambush Special Activities.
4.4.1 Infiltrate. Infiltration enables the NVA to build up its conventional forces or to take over VC forces. It also erodes Opposition.
It may only accompany Rally or March (3.3.1-.2). Infiltrate 1 or 2
spaces that have either an NVA Base or more NVA pieces than VC
pieces.
PROCEDURE: In each space, either—
• If NVA Base(s), place NVA Troops up to the Trail value (6.7) plus
the number of NVA Bases there, then replace any NVA Guerrillas
desired 1 for 1 with added NVA Troops, OR
• If NVA outnumber VC, shift any Opposition there by 1 level toward Neutral. Then replace any 1 VC piece desired with its NVA
counterpart. If replacing a VC Tunneled Base, flip the Tunnel
marker from VC to NVA. In order to remove VC, NVA must have
or make Available the NVA counterpart (1.4.1) and place it in the
VC’s place.
DESIGN NOTE: Infiltration of Northerners could dampen local
revolutionary zeal, as Hanoi’s interference replaced Saigon’s.
4.4.2 Bombard. Bombardment imposes losses on concentrated
enemy troops. It may occur in 1 or 2 spaces with any combination
of at least 3 ARVN and/or US Troops (Police and Special Forces
do not count) or with any US or ARVN Base. Each space also must
have in it or be adjacent to a space with at least 3 NVA Troops.
PROCEDURE: Remove 1 US or ARVN Troop cube from each
selected location, if US, to the Casualties box.
4.4.3 Ambush. Ambush enables the NVA to Attack on the move,
ensure the success of Attacks, and avoid attrition and exposure of
their Guerrillas. It may take place in 1 or 2 spaces selected and paid
for as March destinations (0 cost for LoCs, 3.3.2) or for Attack by
NVA Guerrillas (3.3.3, not yet resolved). At least 1 NVA Guerrilla
that Marched into or will Attack in each space must be Underground
(1.4.3). A free Ambush per an Event (5.5) occurs as if an Attack in
the space.
NOTE: Ambush accompanying Attack modifies that Attack in that
space rather than adding a second Attack there.
PROCEDURE: The NVA Attack in each selected location (at no added cost in Resources). Instead of the usual Attack procedure (3.3.3),
the Attacks in those spaces each remove only 1 enemy piece (Bases
last) but Activate 1 Underground Guerrilla only and automatically
succeed (do not roll; remove the enemy piece normally). Also, do
not remove any NVA pieces even if US Troops removed.
ROAD/RIVER: If a selected Ambush space is a LoC (1.3.4), NVA
may remove the enemy piece from any adjacent space instead (Bases
last), even where another target was just removed.
EXAMPLE: An NVA Guerrilla Ambushing on the 2-Econ Mekong
could remove 1 enemy from either the Mekong, Kien Phong, Kien
Hoa, Can Tho, or Saigon. Selecting Kien Phong would not prevent
a 2nd NVA Guerrilla Ambushing there from also removing an enemy piece.
4.5 VC Special Activities
The VC may choose from Tax, Subvert, or Ambush Special
Activities.
4.5.1 Tax. Taxation enables the VC to gain Resources from areas
they inhabit. They may Tax up to 4 spaces that have Underground
VC Guerrillas and no COIN Control (1.7).
NOTE: There is no COIN Control of LoCs, so VC can Tax there
even if outnumbered. VC can Tax Sabotaged LoCs.
PROCEDURE: For each space, Activate 1 Underground VC Guerrilla there (1.4.3). Add the space’s Econ value or twice its Population
(1.3.2-.4) to VC Resources (1.8). If a Province or City, shift it 1 level
toward Active Support.
4.5.2 Subvert. Subversion replaces ARVN pieces with VC Guerrillas
and saps Patronage. It may only accompany Rally, March, or Terror
(3.3.1, -.2, -.4). It may occur in any 1 or 2 spaces with at least 1
Underground VC Guerrilla and any ARVN cubes.
PROCEDURE: In each space, remove any 2 ARVN cubes or replace
1 there with a VC Guerrilla. Then drop Patronage, -1 for every 2
ARVN pieces removed (or replaced) total (rounded down).
4.5.3 Ambush. VC Ambushes the same as NVA (4.4.3) but using
VC Guerrillas instead.

5.0 EVENTS
Each Event bears a title, Period Event year (2.1), italicized flavor
text, and Event text. Flavor text provides historical interest and has
no effect on play.
5.1 Executing Events
When a Faction executes an Event, it carries out the Event text
literally and in order (sometimes involving actions or decisions by
other Factions). Unless otherwise specified, the executing Faction
makes all selections involved in implementing the text, such as which
pieces are affected or which Faction will execute a free Operation
(5.5). If another Faction is specified or selected to take an action, that
Faction decides the details of the action. Some Events with lasting
effects have markers as aids to play. NOTE: RVN Leaders (2.4.1)
have text that follows the same general rules below as Event text.
5.1.1 Where Event text contradicts rules, the Event takes precedence.
EXAMPLE: NVA executing “Plei Mei” could March as directed
even during Monsoon (2.3.9). However:
• Events may not violate stacking (and so never place Bases where
already 2, nor US or ARVN forces into North Vietnam, 1.4.2).
• Events place only available pieces (1.4.1) and markers unless
specifying from out of play or Casualties; they remove rather than
replace if the replacement is not Available or if stacking (1.4.2)
would be violated.
• Events do not force removal of Tunneled Bases unless removal
of Tunneled Bases is explicitly stated (1.4.4). A Faction may opt
to remove its own Tunneled Base to fulfill Event text.
• Events may not raise Resources, Aid, or Patronage beyond 75 (1.8).
5.1.2 If two Events contradict, the currently played Event takes
precedence. EXAMPLE: US could Air Lift with “MACV” even
with “Typhoon Kate” in effect because MACV directs that “US ...
executes any 1 free Special Activity”.
5.1.3 An executed Event’s text that can be implemented must be.
If not all of its text can be carried out, implement that which can.
5.1.4 Pivotal Events are Events that have preconditions for play and
preempt other Event cards, including Faction order. The executing
Faction must select the Event to play the Pivotal Event card. (See
2.3.8.)
5.2 Dual Use
Many Events have both unshaded and shaded Event text. The executing Faction may select either the unshaded or shaded text to carry
out (not both). While the unshaded text often favors the Counterinsurgents, a player may select either text option regardless of Faction.
DESIGN NOTE: Dual-use events represent opposed effects of the
same cause, forks in the historical road, or instances subject to
alternative historical interpretation.
5.3 Capabilities
Dual-use Events marked “US CAPABILITIES”, “VC CAPABILITIES”, and so on
have lasting effects mainly relating to that
Faction. When executing such an Event,
place the corresponding marker on the appropriate side (unshaded
or shaded) in the Capabilities box. The Event’s effects last for the
rest of the game.
PLAY NOTE: Set out executed Capabilities Event cards near the
affected player(s) as added reminders.
5.4 Momentum
Event text (unshaded, shaded, or both) marked “MOMENTUM”
also includes lasting effects. When executing such text, place the
card in view near the draw pile. It has effects specified to last until
the next Coup round’s Reset phase (6.5), when the card is discarded.
NOTE: Any number of Momentum Events can be in play.
MARKERS: Place the “Medevac” marker on its
appropriate side onto the Event card while in
effect to record which use applies. Place the
“Peace Talks” marker on the “Linebacker II” Pivotal Event card if
unshaded Peace Talks executed and Linebacker II not.
5.5 Free Operations
Some Events allow the Executing or another Faction an immediate
Operation or Special Activity that interrupts the usual sequence of
play and typically is free: it bears no Resource cost and does not affect Eligibility (3.1.2, 2.3.1), though other procedures and restrictions
remain unless modified by Event text (5.1.1). NOTE: Pacification,
Trail Improvement, and Agitation cost Resources even if part of free
Operations (3.2.1, 3.3.1). A free Ambush Special Activity occurs as
if an Attack is occuring in the space (4.4.3).
EXAMPLE: NVA free March (3.3.2) would cost 0 Resources and not
affect NVA Eligibility. Free Raid (4.3.3) would have to Activate an
Underground Ranger to remove enemies.
6.0 COUP ROUNDS
Conduct a Coup Round in the sequence of phases below
as each Coup Card is played, first following any immediate Coup effect (2.4) and adjusting Control (1.7). The
Sequence of Play sheet and board also list this sequence.
EXCEPTION: Never conduct more than 1 Coup Round in a row
(without at least 1 Event card in between)—instead, additional
Coup cards are played (including any new RVN Leader and any
immediate effect) without a Coup Round. If final (2.4.2), end the
game, determine victory (7.3). 

6.1 Victory Phase
If any Faction has met its Victory condition, the game ends (exceptions: Non-player option [1.5]; 1-player [8.9]). See Victory (7.0)
to determine winner and rank order. Otherwise, continue with the
Coup Round. After conducting the final Coup card’s Round (2.4.2),
determine victory per 7.3.
6.2 Resources Phase
Follow these steps to add to Factions’ Resources to a maximum of
75 (1.8).
6.2.1 Sabotage. Sabotage (3.3.4) each unSabotaged LoC where
Insurgent Guerrillas outnumber COIN pieces or adjacent to a City
without COIN Control (until no Sabotage markers remain, VC
chooses which spaces first).
6.2.2 Degrade Trail. If any Laos or Cambodia space is COIN-Controlled, Degrade the Trail by 1 box (6.7).
6.2.3 ARVN Earnings. Add the Aid value to ARVN
Resources. Then add as well the Economic value (1.3.4)
of all LoCs that have no Sabotage (Total Econ, 15
minus the Econ value of any Sabotaged LoCs) and
adjust the “Econ” marker to show that unSabotaged Econ (affecting
US spending of ARVN Resources during the coming Campaign,
1.8.1).
6.2.4 Insurgent Earnings. Add to Resources:
• VC—The number of VC Bases on the map.
• NVA—The number of NVA Bases in Laos and Cambodia, plus
2 times the Trail value (6.7).
6.2.5 Casualties and Aid. Finally, subtract from Aid 3 times the
number of pieces in the Casualties box (3.3.3).
6.3 Support Phase
US, ARVN, and VC may spend Resources to affect popular Support
and Opposition (1.6).
6.3.1 Pacification. The US and then ARVN may spend ARVN Resources to build Support in a combined total of up to 4 Provinces
and/or Cities. EXAMPLE: If the US Pacifies in 3 spaces, ARVN may
do so in only 1; if US in 4, ARVN in none; etc. Each space must have
COIN Control, Police, and the Pacifying Faction’s Troops. Every 3
ARVN Resources spent removes a Terror marker or—once no Terror
is in a space—shifts the space 1 level toward Active Support, to a
maximum of 2 levels per space total during each Support Phase (not
per Faction). The US may not spend Resources below marked Total
Econ (1.8.1, 6.2.3). (See also Training, 3.2.1)
DESIGN NOTE: Troops and Police or local militias together provide
the security needed to gain popular support.
6.3.2 Agitation. VC may spend Resources to encourage Opposition
in up to 4 spaces with VC pieces and no COIN Control (1.7). Every
1 VC Resource they spend removes a Terror marker or—once no
Terror is in a space—shifts the space 1 level toward Active Opposition, to a maximum of 2 levels per space.
6.4 Redeploy Phase
Redeploy forces as follows without adjusting COIN or NVA Control
until afterwards.
6.4.1 Laos and Cambodia. Remove all US and ARVN pieces from
Laos and Cambodia—US Troops to the out of play box, all other pieces to Available boxes.
DESIGN NOTE: The removal from Laos and Cambodia represents
the political cost of too lengthy an operation inside a neutral country.
6.4.2 ARVN Redeploy. The ARVN must move its Troops from
LoCs and Provinces without COIN Bases—and may move any
other ARVN Troops—to any Cities without NVA Control, any US
or ARVN Bases, or Saigon. ARVN then may move any Police to
any LoCs or to any COIN Controlled spaces within South Vietnam.
NOTE: US forces do not Redeploy.
6.4.3 NVA Redeploy. The NVA then may move NVA Troops (only)
from any map spaces to any NVA Bases (even COIN Controlled).
6.4.4 Control. Now adjust COIN and NVA
Control (1.7) to reflect the above moves.
6.4.5 Game End? If and only if this is the final Round (2.4.2), end
and determine victory (7.3).
6.5 Commitment Phase
If not the final Round, take 1 in 3 (round down) US Troop and all
Base Casualty pieces out of play. Put all other US Casualties into
Available boxes. The US then may move up to 10 US Troops and
2 US Bases among the US Available box, any COIN-Control spaces, LoCs, and Saigon. Adjust any changes in Control and Victory
markers (1.9) at the end of the Phase.
NOTE: Commitment is the main time that the US “commits” forces
from Available to South Vietnam or “withdraws” them the other way.
6.6 Reset Phase
Then prepare for the next card as follows:
• If the Trail (6.7) is at 0, Improve it to 1; if it is at 4, Degrade it to 3.
• Remove all Terror and Sabotage markers (3.3.4).
• Flip all Guerrillas and SF Underground (1.4.3).
• Place any Momentum cards that were in effect onto the played
cards—their Events’ effects no longer apply (5.4).
• Mark all Factions Eligible (2.3.1).
• Play the next card from the draw deck and reveal the draw deck’s
new top card (2.3.9).
6.7 The Trail
The (“Ho Chi Minh”) Trail track shows the efficiency
of land and water resupply from North to South Vietnam
as a value from 0 to 4—affecting NVA Rally (3.3.1),
March (3.3.2), Infiltration (4.4.1), and Earnings (6.2.4).
Improving the Trail raises the value; Degrading it decreases the value
(slide the Trail marker along the boxes). Rally (3.3.1), Air Strike
(4.2.3), US/ARVN incursions into Laos or Cambodia (6.2.2), Coup
Round Reset (6.6), and Events (5.0) all can affect the Trail value.
DESIGN NOTE: Trail Degradation represents not only strikes on the
Ho Chi Minh Trail itself but also on sea transport and North Vietnam.

7.0 VICTORY
Each Faction has unique victory conditions, covered below and on
the Faction aid sheets.
7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties
If any Non-player Faction (8.0) passes a victory check (7.2), all
players lose equally. Otherwise, whenever any player does so or
if none does by game end, the Faction that reached the highest
victory margin (7.3) comes in 1st place, 2nd highest comes in 2nd
place, and so on. Ties go to Non-players (8.0), then the VC, then
the ARVN, then the NVA.
7.2 During Coup Rounds
Check victory at the start of each Coup Round (6.1), comparing
the positions of the various victory markers (1.9) to the thresholds
marked on the edge track. Victory conditions are:
• US: Total Support (1.6.2) plus the number of Troops and Bases
in the US Available Forces box exceeds 50.
• NVA: Total NVA-Controlled Population plus the number of NVA
Bases on the map exceeds 18.
• ARVN: Total COIN-Controlled Population plus Patronage
exceeds 50.
• VC: Total Opposition (1.6.2) plus number of VC Bases on the
map exceeds 35.
7.3 After Final Coup
If the final Coup Round (2.4.2) is completed without a victory
check win (7.2), the Faction with the highest victory margin wins.
The victory margin is the amount a Faction is beyond or short of its
condition set forth in 7.2.
NOTE: The victory margin will be positive if the Faction has reached
its goal, negative or zero if it has not.
• US: Total Support + Available US – 50.
• NVA: NVA-Controlled Population + NVA Bases – 18.
• ARVN: COIN-Controlled Population + Patronage – 50.
• VC: Total Opposition + VC Bases – 35.
Victory Deception Option: For less knowledge of how close
Factions in 3- or 4-player games are to winning, each player
at start blindly draws 2 Deception markers. Set aside the rest;
they may not be inspected. Players may reveal their Deception
markers only as they use them:
Empty Threat: No effect (reveal at game end).
Hidden Agenda: Permanently add +1 to the holding player’s
victory margin (7.3).
Hidden Asset: Convert any 1 LimOp option (2.3.5) into a full
Op & Special Activity option.
Handicap Option: If players possess a mix of experience levels, use the above option, but allow the inexperienced players
to secretly select any 2 markers each, least experienced first;
the experienced players then blindly draw 2 markers each from
those remaining.
STOP!
You have read all rules needed for 4 players or
the No Non-Player option with 2 or 3 players
(1.5, recommended for first-time play).
