# Fire in the Lake Playbook - Turn 1

FIRE IN THE LAKE TUTORIAL
By Steve Carey
First-time players should start here!
Welcome to the Tutorial for FIRE IN THE LAKE. Its intent is to
walk you through the game step-by-step, demonstrating important
core system mechanics while also providing familiarity with some
of the various options available to each faction. As such, teaching
the game proper is the primary goal of this example-of-play rather
than depicting optimal strategy.
Since this Tutorial is crafted around a hypothetical 4-player session,
the rules for the non-player factions will not be utilized. This should
make it easier for you to learn the game’s basics by ignoring rules
section 8 in its entirety.
Let’s start by sorting the cards into their three corresponding historical periods as listed in their upper left hand corner: 1964, 1965,
and 1968. We’ll be using only a portion of the 1964 deck, so set
aside all the 1965 and 1968 cards as they won’t be needed for this
demonstration.
Normally the play deck is prepared more randomly, with or without
historical cards (2.1), but for this Tutorial we will sequence the following 12 Event cards, along with Coup! card #125, placing them
face-down in the order listed below to form a 13 card mini-deck.
From bottom to top:
13. (bottom card) Colonel Chau, #112
12. Economic Aid, #43
11. 301st Supply Bn, #51
10. Claymores, #17
09. Sihanouk, #75
08. Coup! card #125, Nguyen Khanh
07. Booby Traps, #101
06. Henry Cabot Lodge, #79
05. Brinks Hotel, #97
04. Gulf of Tonkin, #1
03. Green Berets, #68
02. Trucks, #55
01. (top card) Burning Bonze, #107
The other twelve 1964 cards will not be used in this session, so they
can be returned to the box.
Next, refer to rules section 2.1 and carefully setup the Full Game
(1964-1972) as indicated (back pages of the rulebook). There is
no need to build the complete card deck unless you’re planning to
continue the game upon the Tutorial’s completion.
First a few comments on setup. While the NVA Control North
Vietnam and three Jungle (1.3.2) spaces in Laos/Cambodia (1.3.4),
these do not contribute towards the NVA victory level (NVA Control
+ Bases, 1.9) because their Population level is 0. The NVA do get
credit for their 4 Bases however, as indicated by their victory marker
starting in the 4 space on the Track to begin play.
Note that each faction receives their own Pivotal Event (2.3.8). Such
cards serve as a face-up “home” card separate from the main deck,
available for use (to preempt an Event card 5.1.4 or to possibly trump
another faction’s Pivotal Event) only when the Faction is Eligible
and the card’s prerequisite condition(s) are met. (This example will
not go far enough into the scenario for these conditions to be met.)
Also, the default RVN leader (2.4.1, printed on the map) to begin
the Full Game is Duong Van Minh. His bonus of +5 Aid when the
ARVN perform a Training Operation is active at the start of play.
Minh’s lingering effect will remain valid until a new RVN leader
replaces him or he is cancelled via a Failed Attempt on the next
Coup! card (2.4).
Further, take note of the two overflow boxes (1.3.8). Overflow boxes
are used when too many pieces occupy a space and are therefore
helpful in reducing map clutter.
Now turn over the top card, Burning Bonze, as the first card of the
game. Also reveal the next card, Trucks, which becomes the preview
card for the subsequent turn.
Finally, have one of the four faction foldouts (that say “United
States”, “North Vietnam”, and so on) nearby for referral throughout
this Tutorial.

## PART ONE – Events, Operations, and Special Activities

### GAME TURN 1, Burning Bonze
Looking across the top of the Burning Bonze card, the faction order
(2.3.2) for the turn (from left to right, 2.3) is: VC (blue), NVA (red),
ARVN (yellow), and US (green). At the start of any scenario all
the factions begin Eligible (2.3.1), so the Viet Cong will have first
consideration on this card.
The VC examine the top unshaded portion (pro-COIN) Event of the
card, and also the bottom shaded portion (pro-Insurgent) Event. On
dual Event cards such as these (5.2), either the top or bottom Event
is allowed to be performed on a turn, never both.
The VC initiate play by deciding to execute the shaded Event (5.1),
“Shift Saigon 1 level toward Active Opposition. Aid –12”. Move
the blue VC token from the Eligible box to the 1st Eligible Event
portion of the Sequence of Play (SOP) chart located on the map.
The effect of this Event is dramatic to begin the game – Saigon’s
Passive Support marker is shifted one level towards Active Opposition, making the space Neutral (1.6.1). This results in the marker’s
removal because the absence of any such marker in a space indicates
that it has no Support or Opposition, and is therefore Neutral (1.6.2).
This causes the US’s victory marker (Support + Available, 1.9) to
drop 6 spaces on the track (6 is the population value of Saigon,
1.3.3) from 38 to 32.
The ARVN faction is also impacted by this Event because Aid (1.8)
is lowered by 12. Move the Aid marker on the track from 15 to 3.
There is no immediate effect on ARVN resources (which remain at
30), however resources granted to the ARVN via Aid will dwindle
accordingly during the next Coup Round (6.2.3).
Events don’t cost resources to enact, so the VC player-turn is done.
The NVA is the next listed faction, potentially being 2nd Eligible
(2.3.4). Checking the Sequence of Play chart, we see that since
the 1st Eligible faction (VC) performed the card’s Event, the 2nd
Eligible faction may perform Operations (Op) & an accompanying
Special Activity.
The NVA see that they will be first up on the next card (Trucks), so
the decision whether to go now or to Pass (2.3.3) is at hand. The
NVA decide to Pass. Shift their red token from the Eligible box to
the Pass box, and then increase NVA resources by +1 to 11, moving the NVA token up one box on the Track. When an Insurgent faction
(VC or NVA) Passes, they receive +1 Resource; when a COIN faction (US or ARVN) Passes, the ARVN receive +3 resources (2.3.3).
With the NVA Passing, the ARVN are next in line to be 2nd Eligible.
They indicate their intention to act by moving their yellow Eligibility
token to the Execute Op & Special Activity box on the Sequence of
Play chart. Factions conducting Op & a Special Activity have the
option of performing a chosen Operation first or performing an accompanying Special Activity first, or even interrupting an Op at one
point to conduct an allowed Special Activity (4.1). In this example,
the ARVN will perform an Operation (3.1) first.

With Saigon now at Neutral (no Support), the ARVN don’t want
any insurgent Guerrillas to Rally in and thus infest their capital.
The ARVN will therefore Train (3.2.1) in Saigon, placing a white
pawn in the City. This Operation will cost the ARVN 3 resources,
so lower their marker on the track from 30 to 27.
The ARVN could have chosen other Cities or Provinces without
NVA Control to Train in by similarly placing a white pawn in them
and expending 3 resources per, but for now the ARVN are content
on focusing just on Saigon and saving their resources for later.
Being a City, the ARVN can place 1-2 Rangers or 1-6 of their cubes,
so a choice needs to be made: Rangers or cubes. The ARVN takes 6
of their yellow Troop cubes from Available and places them directly
into Saigon. Police are also cubes and could have been selected
in lieu of some (or all) of the Troop cubes, but the ARVN want to
increase their military presence in the City as much as possible.
The ARVN Train up and Pacify in Saigon.
Since Saigon contains ARVN Troops and Police and is under COIN
Control, the ARVN also opts to now conduct a Pacify (6.3.1) action in 1 Train space, as specifically allowed for by this Operation. Since
Saigon was the only space selected to Train this turn, Pacify will
be done there. Even though permitted by a Training Op, Pacify still
needs to be paid for separately (it is not “free”, 3.1.2, 5.5).
The ARVN spend 3 Resources by moving the Track token down from
27 to 24 to Pacify one level, and they place a Passive Support marker
in Saigon. This returns the US Support + Available (1.9) marker
on the track to 38 (+6 spaces, matching the population of Saigon).
The ARVN could have raised Support one more level to Active
Support by paying 3 additional resources, further protecting their
capital but also bringing the US another 6 points closer to the US
victory threshold (of 50). They decide against doing so for now.
For their Special Activity (refer to the Faction foldout), the ARVN
have the choice to either Govern (4.3.1) or Transport (4.3.2). As
specified, Raid (4.3.3) is not permitted to accompany (4.1.1) a Train
Op so it’s not an option. Govern is thus chosen because the ARVN
want to restore their Aid, which the VC’s just-executed Event has
reduced.
Taking two black pawns (the maximum number of spaces allowed
for this Special Activity), one is placed in An Loc and one in Can
Tho, both population 1 Cities that are also COIN-Controlled. Saigon
can never be a locale for Govern per rule (4.3.1), and besides it was
just selected to Train in so that would disqualify the space anyway.
Hue (a 2 population City) cannot yet be chosen for Govern because
it has no Support (currently at Neutral).
This increases Aid by +6, +3 for each City (3 x 1 population) Governed. Adjust the Aid marker on the track from 3 to 9.
ARVN having just Trained, Aid also receives a +5 bonus because
of the current RVN leader (Minh), so shift the marker up again
from 9 to 14.
Special Activities do not cost resources (4.1), so the ARVN remain
at 24. Remove the one white and two black pawns from the map as
the ARVN has now completed their player-turn.
Since two Eligible factions (the VC 1st and the ARVN 2nd) have
now acted, the turn is over (2.3.6). The US can do nothing (not even
Pass), so their Eligibility token remains in place. Shift the VC and
ARVN Eligibility tokens to the Ineligible box; they won’t be able
to do anything next turn (2.3). The NVA (who Passed) Eligibility
token returns to the Eligible box, joining the US token.
Make Trucks the current card for game turn 2 by placing it atop
Burning Bonze. Reveal the next card (2.3.7) in the deck (Green
Berets), which then becomes the preview card for the turn to follow.
