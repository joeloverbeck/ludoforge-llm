# Fire in the Lake - Playbook Turn 3

GAME TURN 3, Green Berets
The yellow ARVN faction is listed first on Green Berets, and since
they are Eligible, they will be 1st Eligible this turn if they decide to
be so. Indeed, the ARVN wants to perform the top unshaded Event
on this card, so place their Eligibility token in the Execute Event
box on the Sequence of Play chart.
Taking the 3 Special Forces cylinders from the US-led Irregulars box,
the ARVN places them face-down (Underground) into Binh Dinh
Province, which meets the card text requirement of having no NVA
Control. This immediately changes the Province to COIN Control
because the 5 US pieces outnumber the 3 VC pieces. Place a COIN
Control maker in the previously Uncontrolled space, which is a 2
population Province. This grants 2 victory points to the ARVN, so
move their COIN (Control) + Patronage marker on the track up 2
spaces from 35 to 37.
Note that the ARVN does have 2 Rangers in their Available box, but
they opted to utilize the US Special Forces for this Event because
they plan to bring those 2 Rangers into play later during a Train Op
(3.2.1). The 3 ARVN Rangers in the Out of Play box are just that;
those pieces cannot be used until a specified card Event (e.g., the ARVN Pivotal Event card) allows them to enter the game. The US
also may be able to draw pieces from Out of Play via certain Events.
Finishing the Event, it states to set the Province to Active Support.
Place such a marker into Binh Dinh and shift the US victory marker
4 spaces (Active Support, 2 x 2 population = 4) from 38 to 42. This
finishes the ARVN player turn.
The US is next in order on the card, but they are Ineligible, so the
VC can be 2nd Eligible or they can Pass. As indicated on the Sequence of Play, the VC may now perform an Operation & a Special
Activity since the 1st Eligible faction executed the Event. Place the
VC Eligibility token into the Execute Op & Special Activity box on
the chart to indicate this.
The VC will choose Rally (3.3.1) as their Operation and so opt to
place white pawns into Pleiku, Quang Tri, and Hue City. At a cost
of 1 Resource per Rally space, the VC player lowers their resource
token on the Track from 5 to 2. These three spaces are capable of
an Insurgent Rally Op because they have no Support.
In Pleiku, the VC places 2 of their Available Guerrillas Underground:
1 for the VC Base and 1 for the Province’s population. Note that this
procedure differs from an NVA Rally (3.3.1), which uses Bases plus
the Trail value to determine the number of Guerrillas that can place.
In Quang Tri, the VC puts down 3 more Guerrillas, 1 for the VC
Base and 2 for the Province’s population. In Hue, the VC have no
Base so they can place only a single Guerrilla into the City.
Checking for any changes in Control as a result of the new VC
pieces placed onto the map, there are no changes so no markers on
the Track need to be adjusted.
The VC player would like to use their Ambush (4.5.3) Special
Activity in order to start causing US casualties, but Ambush is not
allowed to accompany a VC Rally Op. With Tax or Subvert to choose
from, the VC recall that they are already low on resources, so they
will Tax (4.5.1) in up to 4 allowed spaces.
Place a black pawn into Quang Tin, Quang Duc, and Binh Tuy. Flip
a VC Guerrilla from Underground to Active in each of these three
locations as required by Tax. Double the population value combined
(2 + 1 +1 = 4) from these Provinces is 8, a sum that is then added
to VC resources by moving their marker from 2 to 10 on the Track.
There is a price to be paid however because a part of this Special
Activity is also shifting each Taxed Province or City 1 level towards
Active Support. Flip over the Opposition markers in Quang Tin,
Quang Duc, and Binh Tuy from their Active (2 x population) to
Passive (1 x population) sides. The immediate effect is to reduce the
VC victory marker on the Track by 4, from 27 to 23 as the combined
population value of the three Taxed Provinces is 4.
The VC wanted to Tax in Hue City as their 4th space, but they cannot
because it is under COIN Control. Kien Phong and Kien Giang are
candidates, but the VC decide not to Tax a 4th space, to limit the
damage to Opposition and thus to their victory score.
The turn is now over so remove pawns and then reset the Eligibility
tokens (NVA and US to Eligible, ARVN and VC to Ineligible). Gulf
of Tonkin becomes the current card for Turn 4 once it is placed upon
Green Berets. Reveal the next preview card (which will be Brinks
Hotel) for the turn following.
