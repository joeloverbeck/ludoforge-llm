# Fire in the Lake - Playbook Turn 4

GAME TURN 4, Gulf of Tonkin
The US is first up on the card and they are Eligible, so they will
execute the Event. Move the US Eligibility token to the Event portion
of the Sequence of Play chart.
As denoted on the card, the US first has a free Air Strike (4.2.3)
which is performed according to the standard rules for that Special
Activity. The US decides to select only one space, Quang Tri, which
is occupied by a US Special Forces cylinder and a Troop cube. Quang
Tin, Quang Duc, and Binh Tuy each have an Active (exposed) VC
Guerrilla from their just performed Tax, but these spaces cannot
be targeted for an Air Strike because there are no COIN pieces
present. Other spaces have Insurgents, but cannot be targeted with
Air Strike because all pieces are either Underground Guerrillas or
Bases protected by such Guerrillas.
Remove the two Active VC Guerrillas in Quang Tri to their Available
box, and as a consequence (4.2.3) of this Air Strike also shift the
Province 1 level towards Active Opposition, from Neutral to Passive
Opposition (place marker). This adjusts the VC victory marker from
23 to 25 because Passive Opposition times the location’s population
value equals 2 (1.6.2).
As part of a normal Air Strike, the US also can Degrade the Trail.
Shift the Trail marker from the 2 box to the 1 box.
The US by the Event text can then take 6 of their pieces from Out of
Play and place them into any Cities, thus providing a range of options
here. Selecting 1 Base and 5 Troop cubes, 2 Troops are placed into
Saigon and 3 Troops and a Base are deployed into Hue City. This
strengthens Saigon and Hue, and also gives the US an opportunity
to Pacify in Hue later on when the next Coup! card arrives (6.3.1)
because the US has their own Troops present in addition to (ARVN)
Police and COIN Control.
The taking of the Troop cubes from Out of Play directly to the map
did not impact the US victory marker (1.9) on the Track because
those Troops did not enter (nor leave) the US’s Available display
(1.4.1).
The NVA are next, and they will perform an Operation & a Special
Activity. Move the red Eligibility token to the appropriate box on
the Sequence of Play display.
The NVA issues orders to March (3.3.2) as their Operation. Place
white pawns into Quang Tri, Kien Phong, and Kien Giang to indicate
the chosen locations. This costs the NVA 1 resource per destination
Province, so adjust their resources on the Track from 5 to 2. 
March 2 NVA Guerrillas from The Parrot’s Beak into Kien Phong and
also 2 more Guerrillas from The Parrot’s Beak into Kien Giang. The
Guerrillas all remain Underground because the conditions necessary
to Activate them due to the March (3.3.2) don’t exist.
This changes Control of both Provinces since there are now 3 NVA
pieces present to just 1 from all other factions (in this case, the VC).
Place NVA Control markers on Kien Phong and Kien Giang, and
move the NVA victory marker up from 4 to 8 (the population value
of each of those Provinces is 2, so 2 + 2 = 4).
Next March 2 of the NVA Guerrillas from Central Laos, and all 5
of the NVA Guerrillas from North Vietnam, into Quang Tri. Even
though NVA units Marched from two different spaces, it only costs
them 1 resource to move them all into the one adjacent destination,
Quang Tri. The 7 Guerrillas will remain Underground because
there is no Support (the space is currently at Passive Opposition)
to expose them (3.3.2).
The NVA now have Control of Quang Tri, their 7 Guerrillas barely
outnumbering the combined pieces from all other factions (4 for the
VC, 2 for the US). Place an NVA Control marker into Quang Tri
and shift the NVA victory marker from 8 to 10 to account for the
Controlled Province’s population value.
The lone NVA Base in North Vietnam looks isolated, but it is relatively safe for now because only NVA and VC pieces can stack in
North Vietnam (1.3.5). This means that the US cannot normally Air
Strike (4.2.3) in North Vietnam since no COIN pieces can legally
be in that space.
The NVA still have their Special Activity to perform. They can’t
Bombard (4.4.2) because they don’t have any of the prerequisite
Troops yet on the map. Infiltrate (4.4.1) is allowed to accompany a March, so that’s what the NVA will do. They place a black pawn
into Southern Laos and also in Kien Giang. The NVA would also
like to Infiltrate in Kien Phong, but this particular Special Activity
is limited to 2 spaces maximum, so they cannot.
In Southern Laos, first place 2 NVA Troop cubes, 1 for the Trail +
1 for the Base. Then the NVA opt to exchange the 3 Guerrillas for
3 more NVA Troops, as allowed by Infiltration. Southern Laos now
has a Base and 5 of their Troops, so the NVA are starting to build
up their conventional forces.
Infiltration where NVA pieces outnumber VC can replace a VC piece
with NVA and reduce Opposition. In Kien Giang, Infiltration shifts
Opposition 1 level towards Neutral so flip the marker from Active
to Passive. This knocks the VC victory marker down 2 spaces from
25 to 23 (Kien Giang has a population of 2). Also replace the VC
Guerrilla there with an NVA Guerrilla, leaving the Province fully in
NVA Control with 4 Guerrillas and no other faction pieces present.
The NVA might have Infiltrated in Quang Tri to replace the VC Base
there instead of just a Guerrilla—a more typical and more potent
move—but the NVA player in this case does not want to overly
antagonize the NVA’s southern ally, at least not yet.
The current turn is complete. Remove pawns and then adjust Eligibility tokens (VC and ARVN Eligible, US and NVA Ineligible).
Gulf of Tonkin is covered by Brinks Hotel which is now the current
card. Reveal the next preview card for Turn 6, Henry Cabot Lodge.
