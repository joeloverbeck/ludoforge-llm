# Fire in the Lake rules section one

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Fire in the Lake is a 1- to 4-player board game depicting insurgent
and counterinsurgent (COIN) conflict during the main US period
in Vietnam, 1964-1972, up to the “Paris Peace”. Each player takes
the role of a Faction seeking to set the fate of South Vietnam: the
United States (US), North Vietnamese forces (NVA), the Republic
of Vietnam forces (ARVN), or the southern communist Viet Cong
(VC). Using military, political, and economic actions and exploiting various events, players build and maneuver forces to influence
or control the population, extract resources, or otherwise achieve
their Faction’s aims. A deck of cards regulates turn order, events,
victory checks, and other processes. The rules can run non-player
Factions, enabling solitaire, 2-player, or multi-player games.
Fire in the Lake is Volume IV in the COIN Series of games that
use similar rules to cover modern Insurgencies. The Playbook lists
major rules differences from earlier volumes.
Game set up is explained on pages 23-24 of this rule book. An
index on pages 21-22 lists and defines key game terms. Sequences
and options for player and non-player actions are summarized on
several aid sheets.
1.1 General Course of Play
Fire in the Lake—unlike many card-assisted war games—does not
use hands of cards. Instead, cards are played from the deck one
at time, with one card ahead revealed to all players. Each Event
card shows the order in which the Factions become Eligible to
choose between the card’s Event or one of a menu of Operations
and Special Activities. Executing an Event or Operation carries
the penalty of rendering that Faction Ineligible to do so on the next
card. Coup cards mixed in with the Event cards provide periodic
opportunities for instant wins and for activities such as collecting
resources and influencing popular sympathies.
1.2 Components
A complete set of Fire in the Lake includes:
• A 22”x34” mounted game board (1.3).
• A deck of 130 cards (5.0).
• 229 olive, bright blue, red, yellow, and orange wooden playing
pieces, many embossed (1.4; see “Forces Pool” on the Spaces
List sheet for a complete listing).
• 7 embossed cylinders (1.8, 2.2).
• 6 black and 6 white pawns (3.1.1).
• A sheet of markers.
• 2 Sequence of Play and Spaces List sheets (1.4.1, 2.0, 6.0).
• 4 Faction player aid foldouts (3.0, 4.0, 7.0).
• A Random Spaces and Non-player Events foldout (8.2, 8.4).
• 2 Non-player Operations foldouts (8.5-8.8).
• 3 6-sided dice—1 blue, 1 red, 1 yellow.
• A background play book.
• This rule book.
1.3 The Map
The map shows South Vietnam and nearby areas divided into various
types of spaces.
1.3.1 Map Spaces. Map spaces include rural Provinces, Cities, and
Lines of Communication (LoCs) that are either Highways or the
Mekong river. All spaces—including LoCs—can hold forces. Towns
are not spaces, merely boundaries between adjacent LoCs (1.3.6)
1.3.2 Provinces. Each Province shows a Population value (Pop) of
0, 1, or 2 that affects victory via Support for or Opposition to the
Saigon regime (1.6) or Control (1.7) and some Insurgent actions.
Provinces are further distinguished as Highland, Lowland, or Jungle,
affecting Counterinsurgent Sweeps (3.2.3), Assaults (3.2.4), and
certain Events (5.0).

1.3.3 Cities. Cities similarly show Population value of 1, 2, or 6.
DESIGN NOTE: Each Population value represents about 500,000
citizens of South Vietnam.
1.3.4 LoCs. Each Line of Communication (LoC) space is either
Highway (road) or Mekong (river) or both and shows an Economic
value (Econ) of 0, 1, or 2 affecting ARVN Resource earnings (1.8,
6.2.3) and Viet Cong Taxation (4.5.1). NOTE: LoCs are spaces!
1.3.5 Foreign Countries. The map’s Provinces include parts of
North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. All other spaces are South
Vietnam (“The South”). Only NVA and VC may stack in North
Vietnam (1.4.2). US and ARVN may enter Laos or Cambodia spaces
normally, but at risk of later removal (6.4.1).
1.3.6 Adjacency. Adjacency affects the movement of forces and
implementation of certain Events. Any 2 spaces meeting one of the
following conditions are adjacent:
• Spaces that border on (touch) one another.
• Provinces that would touch but for separation by a LoC.
• LoCs or Provinces separated by Towns.
NOTE: Towns are not spaces; they merely terminate LoCs (1.3.1).
ADJACENCY EXAMPLE: Quang Duc Province and Route 11 are
adjacent via Da Lat, as are Quang Duc and Khanh Hoa across
Route 21.
1.3.7 Coasts. Any spaces adjacent to blue ocean (including across
a LoC) are coastal, affecting the Amphibious Landing, Operation
Starlite, and USS New Jersey Events (5.0).
1.3.8 Overflow. Use “Overflow” boxes for
pieces that exceed the room in a space on the
map; place the lettered marker in that space.
1.4 Forces
The wooden pieces represent the Factions’ various forces: US Troops
(olive cubes), ARVN Troops (yellow cubes) and Police (orange
cubes), NVA Troops (red cubes), NVA and VC Guerrillas, US and
ARVN Special Forces (SF), and all Factions’ Bases.
DESIGN NOTE: ARVN Police represent both urban police and
rural militias such as Regional Forces and Popular Forces. US-led
Irregulars include both CIDG counter-guerrillas and US special
operations forces training them or operating on their own. Bases
represent command, training, and supply facilities as well as political administration.
1.4.1 Availability, Removal, and Out of Play. A “Force Pool” inventory on the Spaces List sheet shows the number of pieces in the
game. Keep forces Available for placement in the Faction’s Available
Forces box (or the US-led Irregulars box). Place NVA and VC Bases
in the highest- and US Bases and Troops in the lowest-numbered
empty spaces to show the number of on-map Bases and Available
US Bases and Troops to help track earnings (6.2) and victory (7.0).
US and ARVN may have forces in the Out of Play box—neither
Available nor on the map—and US forces can become Casualties
(3.3.3, 4.4.2, 5.0, 6.5). Otherwise, forces removed from the map
go to Available.
• Unless otherwise instructed (by Event, 5.1.1), forces may only be
placed from or replaced with those in the Available boxes. A piece
to be replaced by a piece that is unavailable is simply removed
(EXCEPTION: Infiltrate, 4.4.1).
•	 Important: Players while executing an Operation, Special Activity, or Event to place their own forces may take them from
elsewhere on the map (including a Tunneled Base, losing the
Tunnel marker, 1.4.4) if and only if the desired force type is not
Available. EXCEPTION: The US player may do so only with
US-led Irregulars and any ARVN forces, not with US Troops nor
with US Bases.
EXAMPLES: NVA without Available Guerrillas could remove its
own during a Rally (3.3.1) to place them Underground. US Train
could take Police from another space if none Available.
1.4.2 Stacking. No more than 2 Bases (of any Factions) may occupy
a single Province or City. Bases may not occupy LoCs. Only NVA
and VC forces may occupy North Vietnam (1.3.5).
• Placing (such as Bases via Train 3.2.1, Rally 3.3.1, Event 5.1.1, or
Commitment 6.5) or moving forces may never violate stacking.
1.4.3 Underground/Active. Guerrillas and Special Forces are
either Underground—symbol end down—or Active—symbol end
up. Actions and Events flip them from one to the other state. Bases,
Troops, and Police are always Active. Always set up and place new
Cubes:
NVA and VC
Guerrillas:
ARVN Rangers

US-led
Irregulars

Guerrillas and SF Underground (including if replacing a piece).
NOTE: Unless instructions specify “Underground” Guerrilla, it is
sufficient to “Activate” already Active Guerrillas (they stay Active).
Also, “moving” or “relocating” Guerrillas or SF does not affect
Underground status unless specified.
1.4.4 Tunnels. Scenario Setup (2.1) and
Events (5.0) designate certain VC or NVA
Bases as Tunneled. Place an appropriate
Tunnel marker on such a Base, never
more than 1 Tunnel marker at a time per Base. Tunneled Bases are
harder to remove by Operations or Events (3.2.4, 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 4.3.3,
5.1.1). When a Tunneled Base is removed, so is the Tunnel marker.
NVA can Infiltrate a VC Tunneled Base to make it NVA (4.4.1).
1.5 Players & Factions
The game may have up to 4 players, each as 1 or more Factions:
the US (olive), the NVA (red), the ARVN (yellow and orange), or
the VC (blue). In a 1-player game, the player plays US and ARVN
together, or NVA and VC, or any 1 Faction (8.9). Leftover Factions
are controlled either by rules section 8 as “Non-Players” or, if preferred with 2 or 3 players, as below.
No Non-Player Option: With 2 or 3 players, the players
(rather than the Non-Player rules, 8.0) may control any leftover
Factions:
• With 2 players, 1 player controls NVA and VC, the other US
and ARVN.
• With 3 players, a single player controls NVA and VC or, if
preferred, US and ARVN.
POLITBURO: A combined NVA/VC player uses the higher
victory margin of the 2 Factions during Coup Rounds (winning
if either meets its condition, 6.1, 7.2), but uses the lower of the
2 after Final Coup (7.3). A combined NVA/VC player may not
transfer Resources (1.5.2).
SOVEREIGNTY: A US/ARVN player uses the lower victory
margin of the 2 Factions (7.3) and only causes play to end on
a victory check (6.1, 7.2) if both are meeting their conditions.
DESIGN NOTE: NVA, VC, and ARVN pieces draw their colors as
much as possible from their respective flags, US from the olive GI
uniform.
1.5.1 Friends and Enemies. US and ARVN are Counterinsurgent
(COIN) Factions and friendly to each other; NVA and VC are Insurgents and friendly to each other. Counterinsurgents are enemy
to Insurgents.
1.5.2 Negotiation. Players may make any mutual arrangements
within the rules. All negotiations are open. The rules do not bind
players to agreements.
• The NVA and VC if separate players may voluntarily transfer
Resources (1.8) to each other at any time that one of them is
executing an Operation, Special Activity, or Event.
1.6 Support and Opposition
Support and Opposition affect victory and some operations and
activities.
1.6.1 Cities and Provinces with at least 1 Population (1.3.2-3) always
show 1 of 5 levels of its populace’s Support for or Opposition to the
Saigon regime that can shift during play:
• Active Support.
• Passive Support.
• Neutral.
• Passive Opposition.
• Active Opposition.
1.6.2 Active Support or Opposition counts double Population for
Total Support or Opposition—affecting US or VC victory (7.2-.3).
Show Support or Opposition with markers placed in each City or
Province. Show Neutral spaces by the absence of such markers.

Neutral

Total Support =
2 x Pop in Active Support + 1 x Pop in Passive Support
Total Opposition =
2 x Pop in Active Opposition + 1 x Pop in Passive Oppostion
NOTE: LoCs (1.3.4) and Pop 0 Provinces are always Neutral, never
at Support or Opposition.
1.7 Control
The 2 Counterinsurgent Factions together
(US and ARVN) Control a Province or City
if their pieces there combined exceed those
of the other 2 Factions (NVA and VC) combined. The NVA alone Control a Province or City if NVA pieces
exceed all other pieces (including VC). Control affects certain activities and victory. Adjust COIN Control and NVA Control markers
as Control changes due to placement, removal, or movement of
pieces.
1.8 Resources, Aid, and Patronage
At any moment, each Faction except the US has between 0 and 75
Resources that it uses to pay for Operations (3.0). During Coup
Rounds (6.2.3), a level of Aid (between 0 and 75) is added to ARVN
Resources. A level of Patronage (0 to 75) contributes to ARVN
victory (7.0). Mark Resources, Aid, and Patronage on the edge
track—for Resources, with a cylinder of that Faction’s color (1.5).
DESIGN NOTE: Patronage represents the wherewithal of the Saigon
regime to reward its friends at the expense of the population, such
as by diverting foreign aid—a means of governance that the US
could view as corrupt.
1.8.1 Joint Operations. The US does not track its own
Resources. Some US Operations (3.1) and US Pacification (3.2.1, 6.3.1) spend ARVN Resources. The US
may only spend those ARVN Resources that exceed
the marked Total Econ level (1.3.4, 6.2.3). Only the ARVN Faction
may spend ARVN Resources at or below Econ.

1.9 Victory Markers
Similarly track with markers on the edge track the following totals
that affect victory (7.0).
• Total Support (1.6.2) plus the number of US Troops and Bases
Available (1.4.1).
• Total Population Controlled by the NVA plus the number of NVA
Bases on the map (1.7).
• Total Population Controlled by the COIN Factions (1.7) plus
Patronage (1.8).
• Total Opposition (1.6.2) plus the number of VC Bases on the map.
NOTE: A marker on “The Trail” track records the efficiency level of
the NVA’s North-to-South supply network (6.7). Twelve “Deception”
markers are for victory-related optional rules (7.3).
