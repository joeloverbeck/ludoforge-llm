# Fire in the Lake Rules Section 2

2.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
2.1 Set Up
Follow the instructions on the last 2 pages of this rule book to choose
a scenario and various play options, assign Factions to players,
prepare the draw deck, and set up markers and forces.
2.2 Start
Begin play by revealing the top card of the draw deck and placing
it onto a played cards pile. Then reveal the next card on top of the
draw deck. The card on the played card stack is played first; the card
on top of the draw deck will be played next. NOTE: Players will see
1 card ahead into the deck (2.3.7). All played cards and the number
of cards in the draw deck are open to inspection.
RECORD STEPS: As the steps of each Event card play are completed, place a cylinder of the Faction’s color (1.5) into the Sequence
of Play track’s appropriate box (or, for Coup Rounds [6.0], advance
the Coup Card marker).
2.3 Event Card
When playing an Event card, up to 2 Factions will execute Operations or the Event.
• Factions whose cylinder is in the “Eligible” box receive these
options in the left-to-right order of Faction symbols shown at top
of the card.
• Factions with cylinders in the “Ineligible” box do nothing.
2.3.1 Eligibility. Factions that did not execute an Operation or Event
on the previous card are Eligible (their cylinders will start the card
in the “Eligible” box per 2.3.6). Factions that did are Ineligible. (All
Factions start the game Eligible.) See also Free Operations, 3.1.2.
2.3.2 Faction Order. The Eligible Faction with the leftmost symbol
in its color (skipping any Ineligible Factions) is the 1st Eligible to
execute an Operation or Event or to Pass. The next leftmost is the
2nd Eligible. NOTE: Light halos around some Faction symbols
relate only to Non player instructions (8.4.1).
2.3.3 Passing. If a 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction (only!) opts to Pass,
it remains Eligible for the next card and receives +1 Resource if
an Insurgent Faction or adds +3 ARVN Resources if either COIN
Faction. The next leftmost Eligible Faction then replaces the Passing
Faction as the new 1st or 2nd Eligible Faction and receives the same
options to execute or Pass. If the last (rightmost) Eligible Faction
Passes, adjust cylinders (2.3.7) and play the next card.
2.3.4 Options for Eligible Factions.
FIRST ELIGIBLE: If the 1st Eligible Faction does not Pass (2.3.3),
it may execute either:
• An Operation (3.0)—with or without a Special Activity (4.0)—or
• The Event shown on the card.
OPTIONS FOR 2ND ELIGIBLE: If the 2nd Eligible Faction does
not Pass (2.3.3), it also may execute an Operation or possibly the
Event, but its options depend on what the 1st Eligible Faction
executed:
• Op Only: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an Operation, the
2nd Eligible Faction may execute a Limited Operation (2.3.5).
• Op & Special Activity: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed an
Operation with a Special Activity, the 2nd Eligible Faction may
execute a Limited Operation or instead execute the Event.
• Event: If the 1st Eligible Faction executed the Event, the 2nd Eligible Faction may execute an Operation, with a Special Activity
if desired.
NOTE: The game board and Sequence of Play aid sheet also show
these options.
2.3.5 Limited Operation. A Limited Operation is an Operation in
just 1 space, with no Special Activity. If the Limited Operation is a
Patrol (3.2.2), Sweep (3.2.3), or March (3.3.2), it can involve pieces
from multiple spaces but only 1 destination space. A Limited Operation counts as an Operation. (See also Non-player Operations, 8.1).
2.3.6 Adjust Eligibility. After the 1st and 2nd Eligible Factions
complete all execution of Operations, Special Activities, and Events
(or after all Eligible Factions instead have Passed), adjust cylinders
on the Sequence of Play track as follows:
• Any Faction that did not execute an Operation or Event (and was
not rendered Ineligible by an Event) to the “Eligible” box.
• Any Faction that executed an Operation (including a Limited
Operation) or Event to the “Ineligible” box (unless otherwise
specified by the Event; see also Free Operations, 3.1.2).
PLAY NOTE: Some Events (5.0) will enable the executing Faction
to remain Eligible or render other Factions Ineligible through the
next card. As a reminder, mark a Faction thus remaining Eligible by
placing its cylinder at the left edge of its Sequence of Play “Event”
box. Mark a Faction thus rendered Ineligible by placing its cylinder
with (under) the executing Faction’s, to show that it will be Ineligible
for the next card.
2.3.7 Next Card. After adjusting Eligibility, move the draw deck’s
top card onto the played card pile face-up and reveal the draw deck’s
next card (even if the played card is Coup!, 2.4). Play the played
card, proceeding with the appropriate sequence.
2.3.8 Pivotal Events. Each Faction begins the Medium and Full
scenarios (only, 2.1) with a Pivotal Event card unique to it. Pivotal
Events are a type of Event (5.0). A Faction may play its Pivotal
Event to cancel a currently played Event card (including Eligibility
order, 2.3) if:
• That Faction is Eligible, AND
• The red pre-condition on the card is met, AND

• The 1st Eligible Faction has not yet done anything, AND
• No Coup is showing as the next card (2.3.9).
PROCEDURE: The Faction interrupts the usual Sequence of Play
by placing its Pivotal Event card on the played Event card and executing the Pivotal Event. The new Eligibility sequence follows, and
the Pivotal Event stays in the played card pile, as normal.
TRUMPING PIVOTAL EVENTS: The VC may play its Pivotal
Event on top of another Faction’s Pivotal Event, canceling it;
ARVN may do so to US or NVA; NVA may do so to US; US may
not do so. A canceled Pivotal Event card is returned to its owner
for possible later use.
PLAY NOTES: The 1st Eligible Faction need not declare what it
would execute before a Faction must decide whether to play its
Pivotal Event. Place “Playable Pivotal Event” reminder markers
on unplayed Pivotal Event cards for which preconditions are met.
2.3.9 Monsoon Season. On the last Event card before each Coup
Card (2.4), Operations may not include Sweep (3.2.3, even via
Advise, 4.2.1) nor March (3.3.2), US Air Strikes and Air Lifts are
limited to 2 spaces (4.2.2-.3), and no Pivotal Events allowed (2.3.8).
(But see 5.1.1 regarding Event text.)
NOTE: Keep the “Monsoon” marker near the deck and place it on
the played Event card as a reminder while a Coup is showing as
the next card.
2.4 Coup Card
If playing a Coup Card, first carry out any immediate instructions on
the card. Then place the card in the box marked “RVN Leader” (see
below). Finally, conduct a Coup Round (6.0), marking each phase
on the Sequence of Play with the “Coup Card” marker.
2.4.1 RVN Leader. The top (most recently played) Coup card (or
the “RVN Leader” box, if empty) shows the current Republic of
Vietnam (RVN) Leader. Any lingering effects noted for that Leader
are in effect, as if it is the text of a lingering executed Event (5.1,
5.3, 5.4). If the most recently played card is “Failed Attempt”, place
it underneath any previous Coup cards. NOTE: “Failed Attempts”
cancel only “Duong Van Minh”. Minh is an RVN Leader but not
a card. Minh thus does not count as a card in the RVN Leader box
(such as for Pivotal Event pre-conditions, 2.3.8). “Nguyen Cao Ky”
will affect Pacification beginning with that Coup Round (6.3.1).
2.4.2 Final Coup. If the last Coup card’s Round is completed without
a victory (6.1), the game ends: determine victory by 7.3.
NOTE: Each series of Event cards up to a Coup is a “Campaign”,
representing 1-2 years of war.

## Scenarios

SET UP (2.1)

General
Choose a scenario from the next two
pages and any No Non-Player (1.5),
Deception/Handicap (7.3), 1-Player
difficulty (8.9), or Period Events (right)
options desired. Prepare the deck per the
instructions below. Give each player a
Faction foldout and assign Factions
to players (1.5). If Non-players (8.0)
are being used, keep the Non-player
Operations flowcharts and the Random
Spaces foldout nearby.
Deck Preparation
Separate out the 6 Coup cards and 4
Pivotal Events and shuffle the other 120
Event cards. Place or remove Coup or
Pivotal Event cards as instructed.
• Shuffle and randomly deal a number
of Event cards (by Period, if desired)
into equal piles as specified in the
scenario. Shuffle 1 Coup card into
each pile and stack 1 pile onto the
other to form a face-down draw deck
in easy view of all players.
• Set aside the remaining Event cards.
They will not be used and may not be
inspected.
Period Events Option
If desired for events more akin
to the historical periods covered,
select Event cards by scenario as
follows.
Short: 1965-1967
Westy’s War. Set out the “AAA”
card and marker—the shaded
Capability (5.3) is in effect. Then
deal event cards into 8-card piles
only from those marked “1965”.
Medium: 1968-1972
A Better War. Set out the Capability
cards and markers as directed. Deal
event cards into 12-card piles from
those marked “1968”.
Full: 1964-1972
Nam. Form the top pile from 12
random “1964” cards, the 2nd and
3rd topmost piles from 12 “1965”
cards each, and the bottom 3 piles
from 12 “1968” cards each.
NOTE: There are 24 “1964”, 48
“1965”, and 48 “1968” cards.
