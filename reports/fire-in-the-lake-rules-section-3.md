# Fire in the Lake - Rules Section 3

3.0 OPERATIONS
3.1 Operations in General
A Faction executing an Operation (Op) chooses 1 of the 4 Operations listed on its Faction sheet and selects the map spaces (typically
several) to be involved. Select a given space only once for a given
Operation.
Operations usually cost Resources (not Aid or Patronage,1.8), often per
space selected; the paying Faction must have enough Resources to pay
for the Operation, including in each selected space. The US does not
spend Resources of its own; it sometimes spends ARVN Resources,
but may not do so below the marked Total Econ (1.8.1, 6.2.3).
The executing Faction chooses the order of the spaces in which
the Operation is resolved, the enemy Factions (1.5) or pieces to be
affected (targeted), and the friendly pieces to be placed, replaced,
or moved. An Operation may target both enemies or just one and
ignore the other. NOTE: Allied forces nevertheless protect the Bases
of the other friendly Faction from Assault/Attack (3.2.4, 3.3.3). Once
targeted, a Faction’s pieces are affected to the maximum extent possible. Actions affecting another Faction’s pieces, friendly or enemy,
do not require that Faction’s permission.
3.1.1 Pawns. If desired, mark spaces selected for Operations (3.0),
Special Activities (4.0), or other actions with white and black pawns.
The pawns are for convenience, not a limit on play.
3.1.2 Free Operations. Certain Events (5.5) grant free Operations
or Special Activities: they cost no Resources and, if executed by a
Faction other than the one playing an Event, do not affect its Eligibility (2.3.6). EXCEPTIONS: Pacification, Agitation, and Trail
Improvement still cost Resources even if part of a free Operation
(3.2.1, 3.3.1). Other requirements and procedures still apply unless
modified by Event text (5.1.1, 5.5.).
3.2 COIN Operations
The US and ARVN choose from Train, Patrol, Sweep,
and Assault Operations. NOTE: These Factions never
place or move pieces into North Vietnam (1.4.2).
3.2.1 Train. Training adds ARVN forces and can build Support (1.6)
or drop Patronage (1.8). NOTE: The US gets its Troops and Bases
in and out of Vietnam via the Commitment Phase (6.5) and Events
(5.0), not Operations.
• ARVN may select any Provinces or Cities without NVA Control.
• The US may select any Provinces or Cities that have US pieces.
• Either Faction spends 3 ARVN Resources only if it places any
ARVN pieces (including replacing cubes with a Base).
PROCEDURE: First, in those selected spaces desired, if US, place
1-2 Irregulars or, at US Bases, 1-2 Rangers or up to 6 ARVN cubes
(any combination of Troops and Police); if ARVN, place 1-2 Rangers or up to 6 ARVN cubes at Cities or at US or ARVN Bases. If
none of the desired ARVN pieces are Available (1.4.1), they may
be taken from the map. Then, in 1 selected space (even if a Limited
Operation, 2.3.5), if desired either:
• Pacify to remove any Terror marker and then to shift the space
up to 2 levels toward Active Support. The space must have COIN
Control and, if ARVN Training, both ARVN Troops and Police.
(Unlike Pacification during the Support Phase, 6.3.1, the US does
not need Troops and Police, only a US piece and COIN Control.)
The Pacification costs 3 ARVN Resources per Terror marker
removed and level shifted, even if the Training Operation was
free (3.1.2, 5.5). OR
• If ARVN, replace any 3 ARVN cubes with 1 ARVN Base (within
stacking,1.4.2). NOTE: Replacing cubes with a Base costs 3 ARVN
Resources even if no cubes were placed. OR
• If US and the space is Saigon, transfer up to 3 Patronage to ARVN
Resources.
3.2.2 Patrol. Patrolling protects LoCs by moving Troops or Police
onto them and finding and removing Insurgents there. If ARVN,
pay 3 Resources total (not per space); if US, the cost is 0. If a
Limited Operation (2.3.5), all moving cubes must end on a single
destination space.
PROCEDURE: Move any number of your Faction’s cubes from
any spaces. Each cube may move into any adjacent LoC or City
and may keep entering adjacent LoCs or Cities until the player
chooses to stop moving it or it enters a space with any NVA or VC
piece. Then, in each LoC (whether or not a cube just moved there),
Activate 1 enemy Guerrilla for each of your Faction’s cubes there.
Then, if desired, Assault (3.2.4) in 1 LoC at no added cost. US may
not add ARVN. If a Limited Operation (2.3.5), the Assault must be
in the destination LoC.
3.2.3 Sweep. Sweeps may move Troops and can locate enemy Guerrillas. Select Provinces or Cities as destinations (not North Vietnam,
1.4.2). If ARVN, pay 3 Resources per space selected; if US, 0. Sweep
is not allowed in Monsoon (a Coup card showing as next, 2.3.9).
PROCEDURE: First, move any of your Faction’s adjacent Troops
desired into selected spaces. In addition, each group of Troops may
first move onto an adjacent LoC (1.3.3) that is free of NVA/VC
and then into an adjacent space. (Any Troops that move must reach
spaces paid for as destinations.)
• Then, in each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) 1 enemy Guerrilla
for each of your cubes (moved or already there) or Special Forces
(Irregulars for US, Rangers for ARVN).
• In Jungle spaces, Activate only 1 enemy Guerrilla for every 2 of
your cubes or Special Forces (round odd totals down).
SWEEP EXAMPLE: ARVN selects Quang Duc for a Sweep. No LoCs
have Guerrillas. Two Troops move from Cam Ranh onto Route 11
and from there via Da Lat into Quang Duc Province. ARVN Troops
in Binh Tuy – Binh Thuan also could enter Quang Duc.
3.2.4 Assault. Assaults remove enemy pieces. Select any spaces with
the executing Faction’s cubes and Insurgents (NVA or VC). ARVN
pay 3 Resources per space. US Assault costs 3 ARVN Resources only
if the US player opts to add an ARVN Assault in 1 US Assault space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, remove enemy pieces per
the number of cubes there, as follows.
• If an ARVN Assault, count only ARVN cubes. Remove 1 enemy
piece for every 2 cubes there or every 3 in Highland (round down).
In Cities or on LoCs, count Police as well as Troops; in Provinces,
Troops only. For each Base removed (including via follow up to
US Assault, below, or Advise, 4.2.1), add +6 Aid.
• If a US Assault, count US Troops. Remove 2 enemies per US
Troops cube if the space has a US Base, or only 1 enemy for
every 2 US Troops (round down) if Highland with no US Base,
or otherwise 1 enemy piece for each US Troop. If desired, pay
3 ARVN Resources to follow up with an ARVN Assault per the
above bullet in 1 space where US Assault just occurred (no effect
on ARVN Eligibility, 2.3.1).
TROOPS FIRST, BASES LAST: Remove any NVA Troops in an
Assault space first, then any Active NVA or VC Guerrillas (Assaulting Faction chooses which first), then any Insurgent Bases only
once no NVA nor VC Guerrillas remain. Remove no Underground
Guerrillas (1.4.3).
NOTE: Underground Guerrillas in a space prevent further removal
via Assault of Bases until the Guerrillas are Activated. Also, nonBase pieces protect the Bases of the other friendly Faction from
Assault/Attack (3.3.3).
DESIGN NOTE: Guerrillas are less hard hitting than Troops but
enjoy an information advantage in that counterinsurgents must
Activate (locate) them before Assaulting them.
TUNNELS: If the next piece to be removed would be a Base with a
Tunnel marker (1.4.4), stop removing pieces from that space. Instead,
roll a die: on a 1-3, do nothing further; on a 4-6, remove that Tunnel
marker only (leave the Base in place). EXAMPLE: Three US Troops
Assault 2 Tunneled Bases alone in Jungle. No pieces are removed.
On a roll of 4-6, a Tunnel marker is removed from one Base.
3.3 Insurgent Operations
The NVA and VC choose from Rally, March, Attack, or
Terror Operations.
3.3.1 Rally. Rally Operations augment friendly forces, recover VC,
and build the Trail. Select any Provinces or Cities without Support
(1.6). Pay 1 Resource per space selected.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, the executing Faction places
1 of its Available Guerrillas or replaces 2 of its Guerrillas with 1 of
its Bases (within stacking 1.4.2). If the space already has at least 1
of that Faction’s Bases, the Faction may instead:
• If NVA, place a number of its Guerrillas up to the sum of Trail
value (6.7) plus the number of NVA Bases there.
• If VC, place its Guerrillas up to the sum of the space’s Population
value (1.3.2-.3) plus the number of VC Bases there OR flip all its
Guerrillas there Underground (1.4.3). NOTE: VC may Agitate as
well if it has the shaded “Cadres” Capability (5.3); that Agitation
costs Resources even if the Rally was free (3.1.2, 5.5).
Then, NVA with its Rally may spend another 2 Resources to Improve
the Trail by 1 box (6.7, even if the Rally was a Limited Operation,
2.3.5, or selected 0 spaces). Rally to Improve the Trail costs 2 even
if the Rally was free (3.1.2, 5.5).
3.3.2 March. March Operations move Insurgent Guerrillas and
Troops. Moving pieces may begin in any spaces. Pay 1 Resource
per Province or City that Guerrillas or Troops move into (0 Resources to move onto LoCs). A Limited Operation (2.3.5) March
may select only a single destination space. March is not allowed in
Monsoon (2.3.9).
PROCEDURE: The executing Faction moves any of its Guerrillas
or Troops desired into adjacent spaces (1.3.6). Pieces moving from 1
space to another move as a single group. Set Guerrillas of a moving
group to Active (1.4.3) if:
• The destination is a LoC or has any Support (1.6) AND
• The moving group’s number of pieces plus the number of US and
ARVN cubes, Irregulars, and Rangers at the destination exceeds 3.
EXAMPLE: Two Underground VC Guerrillas March from The
Parrot’s Beak into Kien Phong, where there are 2 Police cubes and
Support. The total of 4 relevant pieces at the destination exceeds 3,
so the VC Guerrillas flip to Active.
THE TRAIL: Marching NVA Guerrillas and Troops (not VC) may
continue moving into additional spaces (paying once only for each
added destination) if the previous destination space was in Laos or
Cambodia (1.3.5), the Trail value is above 0 (6.7), and the March is
not a LimOp (2.3.5). Also, if the Trail value is 4, NVA March into
or out of individual Laos or Cambodia spaces costs 0 Resources.
NOTE: COIN Control does not stop such moves (1.7).
3.3.3 Attack. Attack Operations seek to eliminate enemy forces.
Select any spaces where the executing Faction and an enemy have
pieces; pay 1 Resource per space.
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, Activate (1.4.3) all the
executing Faction’s Guerrillas and then roll a die: if the roll is less
than or equal to the number of the executing Faction’s Guerrillas
there (whether or not they began Active), remove up to 2 enemy
pieces (executing Faction’s choice). The NVA may instead remove
1 enemy piece per 2 NVA Troops there (round down, Activate no
Guerrillas). Removed pieces may belong to different Factions and
may be Underground Special Forces.
• Do not remove US or ARVN Bases before any other pieces of
either Faction in the space.
CASUALTIES: Place any US pieces removed by Attack into the
Casualties box.
ATTRITION: For each US Troop cube or US Base removed, the
Attacking Faction must remove 1 of its Attacking pieces (Troops
or Guerrillas, whichever used) from the space.
3.3.4 Terror. Terror Operations in Cities or Provinces affect Support and Opposition (1.6) and
place Terror markers that hinder future efforts to
influence it. On LoCs, they place Sabotage markers that block ARVN
Resource earnings (6.2.1). Select any spaces where the executing
Faction has at least 1 Underground Guerrilla or, for NVA Terror, NVA
Troop cube; pay 1 Resource per Province or City (0 for LoCs).
PROCEDURE: Activate 1 friendly Underground Guerrilla in each
selected space (if any there).
• If the space is a Province or City without a Terror marker, place
a Terror marker. If VC, shift 1 level toward Active Opposition
(1.6). If NVA, shift any Support 1 level toward Neutral.
• If the space is a LoC without a Sabotage marker, place a Sabotage
marker.
• Do not place a Terror/Sabotage marker if all are already on the
map. (There are 15.)
NOTE: Terror Ops will not add Terror or Sabotage markers to
spaces that already have them. (Certain events can do so, 5.1.1).
