# Fire in the Lake - Rules Section 4

4.0 SPECIAL ACTIVITIES
4.1 Special Activities in General
When a Faction per the Event Card sequence of play (2.3) executes
an Operation (3.0), it may also execute 1 type of its Special Activities (EXCEPTION: Limited Operations, 2.3.5). There is no added
Resource cost for the Special Activity. As with Operations, the
executing Faction selects spaces, Factions, or pieces affected and
the order of actions. Select a given space only once as a location
for a given Special Activity. (But see removal of adjacent pieces
via Ambush from Road/River locations, 4.4.3). Events may grant
free Special Activities (not further affecting Eligibility, 3.1.2, 5.5).
•	 Important: A Faction may execute its Special Activity at any one
time immediately before, during, or immediately after its Operation.
EXAMPLE: The VC Rally until at 0 Resources, then pause to Tax
and gain Resources, then continue to Rally in added spaces.
PLAY NOTE: If the 1st Eligible Faction uses a Special Activity, the
2nd Eligible receives the option of executing the card’s Event, and
vice versa (2.3.4).
4.1.1. Accompanying Operations. Some Special Activities specify
that they may only accompany certain types of Operations (3.0).
Certain Special Activities either must occur or may not occur where
their Accompanying Operations occurred. If not otherwise specified,
Special Activities may accompany any Operations and take place
in any otherwise valid spaces.
4.2 US Special Activities
The US may choose from Advise, Air Lift, or Air Strike
Special Activities.
4.2.1 Advise. Advise strikes with indigenous allied forces and can
add to Aid (1.8). It may only accompany Training or Patrol (3.2.1-
.2) and take place in 1 or 2 spaces NOT selected for Training (never
North Vietnam, 1.4.2).
PROCEDURE: In each selected space, either:
• Sweep within the space with ARVN forces as if an ARVN Sweep
there without movement (3.2.3, not in Monsoon, 2.3.9), OR
• Assault there as if ARVN Assault (3.2.4), OR
• Activate 1 Underground Irregular or Ranger there to remove 2
enemy pieces. Bases may only be removed once no other enemy
pieces are there. Tunneled Bases (1.4.4) may not be removed
(Underground Guerrillas may).
Then, if desired, add +6 Aid total (to max of 75).
4.2.2 Air Lift. Air Lift moves Troops, especially to mass them
quickly for an Operation.
PROCEDURE: Move any US Troops and up to 4 ARVN Troops,
Rangers, or Irregulars among any 4 spaces (2 spaces during Monsoon, 2.3.9; not North Vietnam, 1.4.2).
4.2.3 Air Strike. Air Strike destroys exposed Insurgent units. It may
take place in up to 6 spaces (2 spaces during Monsoon, 2.3.9), each
with any US or ARVN piece in it.
PROCEDURE: Remove a total of up to 6 Active enemy pieces
(6 pieces even during Monsoon) from among the selected spaces.
Remove Bases only from spaces where no other Insurgent pieces
remain. Remove no Underground Guerrillas nor Tunneled Bases.
Shift each space selected 1 level toward Active Opposition (if a
Province or City with at least 1 Population, 1.6.1). Then, if desired,
Degrade the Trail by 1 box (6.7), even if 0 pieces removed.
4.3 ARVN Special Activities
The ARVN chooses from Govern, Transport, or Raid Special
Activities.
4.3.1 Govern. Governing adds Aid or extracts Patronage from Aid
and Support. It may only accompany Training or Patrol (3.2.1-.2)
and take place in 1 or 2 COIN-Controlled Provinces or Cities (1.7)
with any level of Support (1.6) NOT Saigon NOR selected for
Training. NOTE: ARVN may Train and Govern but not in the same
space during the same Op.
PROCEDURE: In each space, either:
• Add 3 times the space’s Population to Aid (to a maximum of 75),
OR
• Transfer its Population value (times 1) from Aid to Patronage
(max 75) and shift the space 1 level toward Neutral. There must
be more ARVN cubes (Troops and Police total) than US cubes
(Troops) in the space.
DESIGN NOTE: South Vietnamese officials may Govern benignly
to attract more foreign aid, or less benignly to divert more aid to
associates.
4.3.2 Transport. Transport moves Troops and Rangers, to take
control of countryside, for example, and prepares Rangers for Raids.
PROCEDURE: Select 1 space and move up to 6 ARVN Troops and/
or Rangers from there onto 1 or more adjacent LoCs, if desired.
They may continue to move along adjacent LoCs or through Cities
and then, if desired, into any adjacent destinations (not North Vietnam, 1.4.2). They must stop at any NVA or VC pieces. Then flip all
Rangers anywhere on the map to Underground.
4.3.3 Raid. Raiding repositions and strikes with the ARVN’s special
forces—Rangers. It may only accompany Patrol, Sweep, or Assault
(3.2.2-.4) and take place in 1 or 2 spaces.
PROCEDURE: Each selected space, move in any adjacent Rangers desired (keeping them either Underground or Active). Then, if
desired, Activate an Underground Ranger in each space to remove
2 enemy pieces. Bases may only be removed once no other enemy
pieces are there. Tunneled Bases (1.4.4) may not be removed (Underground Guerrillas may).
4.4 NVA Special Activities
The NVA choose from Infiltrate, Bombard, or Ambush Special Activities.
4.4.1 Infiltrate. Infiltration enables the NVA to build up its conventional forces or to take over VC forces. It also erodes Opposition.
It may only accompany Rally or March (3.3.1-.2). Infiltrate 1 or 2
spaces that have either an NVA Base or more NVA pieces than VC
pieces.
PROCEDURE: In each space, either—
• If NVA Base(s), place NVA Troops up to the Trail value (6.7) plus
the number of NVA Bases there, then replace any NVA Guerrillas
desired 1 for 1 with added NVA Troops, OR
• If NVA outnumber VC, shift any Opposition there by 1 level toward Neutral. Then replace any 1 VC piece desired with its NVA
counterpart. If replacing a VC Tunneled Base, flip the Tunnel
marker from VC to NVA. In order to remove VC, NVA must have
or make Available the NVA counterpart (1.4.1) and place it in the
VC’s place.
DESIGN NOTE: Infiltration of Northerners could dampen local
revolutionary zeal, as Hanoi’s interference replaced Saigon’s.
4.4.2 Bombard. Bombardment imposes losses on concentrated
enemy troops. It may occur in 1 or 2 spaces with any combination
of at least 3 ARVN and/or US Troops (Police and Special Forces
do not count) or with any US or ARVN Base. Each space also must
have in it or be adjacent to a space with at least 3 NVA Troops.
PROCEDURE: Remove 1 US or ARVN Troop cube from each
selected location, if US, to the Casualties box.
4.4.3 Ambush. Ambush enables the NVA to Attack on the move,
ensure the success of Attacks, and avoid attrition and exposure of
their Guerrillas. It may take place in 1 or 2 spaces selected and paid
for as March destinations (0 cost for LoCs, 3.3.2) or for Attack by
NVA Guerrillas (3.3.3, not yet resolved). At least 1 NVA Guerrilla
that Marched into or will Attack in each space must be Underground
(1.4.3). A free Ambush per an Event (5.5) occurs as if an Attack in
the space.
NOTE: Ambush accompanying Attack modifies that Attack in that
space rather than adding a second Attack there.
PROCEDURE: The NVA Attack in each selected location (at no added cost in Resources). Instead of the usual Attack procedure (3.3.3),
the Attacks in those spaces each remove only 1 enemy piece (Bases
last) but Activate 1 Underground Guerrilla only and automatically
succeed (do not roll; remove the enemy piece normally). Also, do
not remove any NVA pieces even if US Troops removed.
ROAD/RIVER: If a selected Ambush space is a LoC (1.3.4), NVA
may remove the enemy piece from any adjacent space instead (Bases
last), even where another target was just removed.
EXAMPLE: An NVA Guerrilla Ambushing on the 2-Econ Mekong
could remove 1 enemy from either the Mekong, Kien Phong, Kien
Hoa, Can Tho, or Saigon. Selecting Kien Phong would not prevent
a 2nd NVA Guerrilla Ambushing there from also removing an enemy piece.
4.5 VC Special Activities
The VC may choose from Tax, Subvert, or Ambush Special
Activities.
4.5.1 Tax. Taxation enables the VC to gain Resources from areas
they inhabit. They may Tax up to 4 spaces that have Underground
VC Guerrillas and no COIN Control (1.7).
NOTE: There is no COIN Control of LoCs, so VC can Tax there
even if outnumbered. VC can Tax Sabotaged LoCs.
PROCEDURE: For each space, Activate 1 Underground VC Guerrilla there (1.4.3). Add the space’s Econ value or twice its Population
(1.3.2-.4) to VC Resources (1.8). If a Province or City, shift it 1 level
toward Active Support.
4.5.2 Subvert. Subversion replaces ARVN pieces with VC Guerrillas
and saps Patronage. It may only accompany Rally, March, or Terror
(3.3.1, -.2, -.4). It may occur in any 1 or 2 spaces with at least 1
Underground VC Guerrilla and any ARVN cubes.
PROCEDURE: In each space, remove any 2 ARVN cubes or replace
1 there with a VC Guerrilla. Then drop Patronage, -1 for every 2
ARVN pieces removed (or replaced) total (rounded down).
4.5.3 Ambush. VC Ambushes the same as NVA (4.4.3) but using
VC Guerrillas instead.
