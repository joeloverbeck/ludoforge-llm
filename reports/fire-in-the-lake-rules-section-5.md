# Fire in the Lake - Rules Section 5

5.0 EVENTS
Each Event bears a title, Period Event year (2.1), italicized flavor
text, and Event text. Flavor text provides historical interest and has
no effect on play.
5.1 Executing Events
When a Faction executes an Event, it carries out the Event text
literally and in order (sometimes involving actions or decisions by
other Factions). Unless otherwise specified, the executing Faction
makes all selections involved in implementing the text, such as which
pieces are affected or which Faction will execute a free Operation
(5.5). If another Faction is specified or selected to take an action, that
Faction decides the details of the action. Some Events with lasting
effects have markers as aids to play. NOTE: RVN Leaders (2.4.1)
have text that follows the same general rules below as Event text.
5.1.1 Where Event text contradicts rules, the Event takes precedence.
EXAMPLE: NVA executing “Plei Mei” could March as directed
even during Monsoon (2.3.9). However:
• Events may not violate stacking (and so never place Bases where
already 2, nor US or ARVN forces into North Vietnam, 1.4.2).
• Events place only available pieces (1.4.1) and markers unless
specifying from out of play or Casualties; they remove rather than
replace if the replacement is not Available or if stacking (1.4.2)
would be violated.
• Events do not force removal of Tunneled Bases unless removal
of Tunneled Bases is explicitly stated (1.4.4). A Faction may opt
to remove its own Tunneled Base to fulfill Event text.
• Events may not raise Resources, Aid, or Patronage beyond 75 (1.8).
5.1.2 If two Events contradict, the currently played Event takes
precedence. EXAMPLE: US could Air Lift with “MACV” even
with “Typhoon Kate” in effect because MACV directs that “US ...
executes any 1 free Special Activity”.
5.1.3 An executed Event’s text that can be implemented must be.
If not all of its text can be carried out, implement that which can.
5.1.4 Pivotal Events are Events that have preconditions for play and
preempt other Event cards, including Faction order. The executing
Faction must select the Event to play the Pivotal Event card. (See
2.3.8.)
5.2 Dual Use
Many Events have both unshaded and shaded Event text. The executing Faction may select either the unshaded or shaded text to carry
out (not both). While the unshaded text often favors the Counterinsurgents, a player may select either text option regardless of Faction.
DESIGN NOTE: Dual-use events represent opposed effects of the
same cause, forks in the historical road, or instances subject to
alternative historical interpretation.
5.3 Capabilities
Dual-use Events marked “US CAPABILITIES”, “VC CAPABILITIES”, and so on
have lasting effects mainly relating to that
Faction. When executing such an Event,
place the corresponding marker on the appropriate side (unshaded
or shaded) in the Capabilities box. The Event’s effects last for the
rest of the game.
PLAY NOTE: Set out executed Capabilities Event cards near the
affected player(s) as added reminders.
5.4 Momentum
Event text (unshaded, shaded, or both) marked “MOMENTUM”
also includes lasting effects. When executing such text, place the
card in view near the draw pile. It has effects specified to last until
the next Coup round’s Reset phase (6.5), when the card is discarded.
NOTE: Any number of Momentum Events can be in play.
MARKERS: Place the “Medevac” marker on its
appropriate side onto the Event card while in
effect to record which use applies. Place the
“Peace Talks” marker on the “Linebacker II” Pivotal Event card if
unshaded Peace Talks executed and Linebacker II not.
5.5 Free Operations
Some Events allow the Executing or another Faction an immediate
Operation or Special Activity that interrupts the usual sequence of
play and typically is free: it bears no Resource cost and does not affect Eligibility (3.1.2, 2.3.1), though other procedures and restrictions
remain unless modified by Event text (5.1.1). NOTE: Pacification,
Trail Improvement, and Agitation cost Resources even if part of free
Operations (3.2.1, 3.3.1). A free Ambush Special Activity occurs as
if an Attack is occuring in the space (4.4.3).
EXAMPLE: NVA free March (3.3.2) would cost 0 Resources and not
affect NVA Eligibility. Free Raid (4.3.3) would have to Activate an
Underground Ranger to remove enemies.
