# Fire in the Lake - Rules Section 6

6.0 COUP ROUNDS
Conduct a Coup Round in the sequence of phases below
as each Coup Card is played, first following any immediate Coup effect (2.4) and adjusting Control (1.7). The
Sequence of Play sheet and board also list this sequence.
EXCEPTION: Never conduct more than 1 Coup Round in a row
(without at least 1 Event card in between)—instead, additional
Coup cards are played (including any new RVN Leader and any
immediate effect) without a Coup Round. If final (2.4.2), end the
game, determine victory (7.3). 
6.1 Victory Phase
If any Faction has met its Victory condition, the game ends (exceptions: Non-player option [1.5]; 1-player [8.9]). See Victory (7.0)
to determine winner and rank order. Otherwise, continue with the
Coup Round. After conducting the final Coup card’s Round (2.4.2),
determine victory per 7.3.
6.2 Resources Phase
Follow these steps to add to Factions’ Resources to a maximum of
75 (1.8).
6.2.1 Sabotage. Sabotage (3.3.4) each unSabotaged LoC where
Insurgent Guerrillas outnumber COIN pieces or adjacent to a City
without COIN Control (until no Sabotage markers remain, VC
chooses which spaces first).
6.2.2 Degrade Trail. If any Laos or Cambodia space is COIN-Controlled, Degrade the Trail by 1 box (6.7).
6.2.3 ARVN Earnings. Add the Aid value to ARVN
Resources. Then add as well the Economic value (1.3.4)
of all LoCs that have no Sabotage (Total Econ, 15
minus the Econ value of any Sabotaged LoCs) and
adjust the “Econ” marker to show that unSabotaged Econ (affecting
US spending of ARVN Resources during the coming Campaign,
1.8.1).
6.2.4 Insurgent Earnings. Add to Resources:
• VC—The number of VC Bases on the map.
• NVA—The number of NVA Bases in Laos and Cambodia, plus
2 times the Trail value (6.7).
6.2.5 Casualties and Aid. Finally, subtract from Aid 3 times the
number of pieces in the Casualties box (3.3.3).
6.3 Support Phase
US, ARVN, and VC may spend Resources to affect popular Support
and Opposition (1.6).
6.3.1 Pacification. The US and then ARVN may spend ARVN Resources to build Support in a combined total of up to 4 Provinces
and/or Cities. EXAMPLE: If the US Pacifies in 3 spaces, ARVN may
do so in only 1; if US in 4, ARVN in none; etc. Each space must have
COIN Control, Police, and the Pacifying Faction’s Troops. Every 3
ARVN Resources spent removes a Terror marker or—once no Terror
is in a space—shifts the space 1 level toward Active Support, to a
maximum of 2 levels per space total during each Support Phase (not
per Faction). The US may not spend Resources below marked Total
Econ (1.8.1, 6.2.3). (See also Training, 3.2.1)
DESIGN NOTE: Troops and Police or local militias together provide
the security needed to gain popular support.
6.3.2 Agitation. VC may spend Resources to encourage Opposition
in up to 4 spaces with VC pieces and no COIN Control (1.7). Every
1 VC Resource they spend removes a Terror marker or—once no
Terror is in a space—shifts the space 1 level toward Active Opposition, to a maximum of 2 levels per space.
6.4 Redeploy Phase
Redeploy forces as follows without adjusting COIN or NVA Control
until afterwards.
6.4.1 Laos and Cambodia. Remove all US and ARVN pieces from
Laos and Cambodia—US Troops to the out of play box, all other pieces to Available boxes.
DESIGN NOTE: The removal from Laos and Cambodia represents
the political cost of too lengthy an operation inside a neutral country.
6.4.2 ARVN Redeploy. The ARVN must move its Troops from
LoCs and Provinces without COIN Bases—and may move any
other ARVN Troops—to any Cities without NVA Control, any US
or ARVN Bases, or Saigon. ARVN then may move any Police to
any LoCs or to any COIN Controlled spaces within South Vietnam.
NOTE: US forces do not Redeploy.
6.4.3 NVA Redeploy. The NVA then may move NVA Troops (only)
from any map spaces to any NVA Bases (even COIN Controlled).
6.4.4 Control. Now adjust COIN and NVA
Control (1.7) to reflect the above moves.
6.4.5 Game End? If and only if this is the final Round (2.4.2), end
and determine victory (7.3).
6.5 Commitment Phase
If not the final Round, take 1 in 3 (round down) US Troop and all
Base Casualty pieces out of play. Put all other US Casualties into
Available boxes. The US then may move up to 10 US Troops and
2 US Bases among the US Available box, any COIN-Control spaces, LoCs, and Saigon. Adjust any changes in Control and Victory
markers (1.9) at the end of the Phase.
NOTE: Commitment is the main time that the US “commits” forces
from Available to South Vietnam or “withdraws” them the other way.
6.6 Reset Phase
Then prepare for the next card as follows:
• If the Trail (6.7) is at 0, Improve it to 1; if it is at 4, Degrade it to 3.
• Remove all Terror and Sabotage markers (3.3.4).
• Flip all Guerrillas and SF Underground (1.4.3).
• Place any Momentum cards that were in effect onto the played
cards—their Events’ effects no longer apply (5.4).
• Mark all Factions Eligible (2.3.1).
• Play the next card from the draw deck and reveal the draw deck’s
new top card (2.3.9).
6.7 The Trail
The (“Ho Chi Minh”) Trail track shows the efficiency
of land and water resupply from North to South Vietnam
as a value from 0 to 4—affecting NVA Rally (3.3.1),
March (3.3.2), Infiltration (4.4.1), and Earnings (6.2.4).
Improving the Trail raises the value; Degrading it decreases the value
(slide the Trail marker along the boxes). Rally (3.3.1), Air Strike
(4.2.3), US/ARVN incursions into Laos or Cambodia (6.2.2), Coup
Round Reset (6.6), and Events (5.0) all can affect the Trail value.
DESIGN NOTE: Trail Degradation represents not only strikes on the
Ho Chi Minh Trail itself but also on sea transport and North Vietnam.
