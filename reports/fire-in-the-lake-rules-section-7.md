# Fire in the Lake - Rules Section 7

7.0 VICTORY
Each Faction has unique victory conditions, covered below and on
the Faction aid sheets.
7.1 Ranking Wins and Breaking Ties
If any Non-player Faction (8.0) passes a victory check (7.2), all
players lose equally. Otherwise, whenever any player does so or
if none does by game end, the Faction that reached the highest
victory margin (7.3) comes in 1st place, 2nd highest comes in 2nd
place, and so on. Ties go to Non-players (8.0), then the VC, then
the ARVN, then the NVA.
(Note by developer: we aren't going to implement Non-player factions the way the game does, as we're creating our own universal bots. So disregard any special rules for non-player factions.)
7.2 During Coup Rounds
Check victory at the start of each Coup Round (6.1), comparing
the positions of the various victory markers (1.9) to the thresholds
marked on the edge track. Victory conditions are:
• US: Total Support (1.6.2) plus the number of Troops and Bases
in the US Available Forces box exceeds 50.
• NVA: Total NVA-Controlled Population plus the number of NVA
Bases on the map exceeds 18.
• ARVN: Total COIN-Controlled Population plus Patronage
exceeds 50.
• VC: Total Opposition (1.6.2) plus number of VC Bases on the
map exceeds 35.
7.3 After Final Coup
If the final Coup Round (2.4.2) is completed without a victory
check win (7.2), the Faction with the highest victory margin wins.
The victory margin is the amount a Faction is beyond or short of its
condition set forth in 7.2.
NOTE: The victory margin will be positive if the Faction has reached
its goal, negative or zero if it has not.
• US: Total Support + Available US – 50.
• NVA: NVA-Controlled Population + NVA Bases – 18.
• ARVN: COIN-Controlled Population + Patronage – 50.
• VC: Total Opposition + VC Bases – 35.
