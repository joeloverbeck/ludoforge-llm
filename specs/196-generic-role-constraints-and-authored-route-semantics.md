# Spec 196 — Generic Role Constraints and Authored Route/Map Semantics

**Status**: PROPOSED
**Priority**: High — the only landed role constraint is `notEqual`, which is insufficient for the FITL competence report's ARVN Transport origin-control / NVA route logistics / VC underground positioning requirements. Spec 191 §2 explicitly deferred new constraint kinds "as a follow-up justified by a concrete authoring need"; the second-iteration audit and the FITL competence requirements together supply that need.
**Complexity**: M–L — extends the compiler validator and runtime constraint evaluator, adds a generic authored-route/map data-asset reader, and migrates the FITL profile to use the new constraints where they replace existing guardrail/quality workarounds. No new selector sources, no game-specific engine kinds.
**Date**: 2026-05-26
**Dependencies**:
- `archive/specs/186-advisory-turn-plan-architecture-core.md` (COMPLETED — plan templates, role selectors, execution controller)
- `archive/specs/187-whole-turn-posture-and-ally-rival-metadata.md` (COMPLETED — posture + relationship metadata)
- `archive/specs/191-plan-role-semantic-integrity.md` (COMPLETED — `SUPPORTED_PLAN_ROLE_CONSTRAINT_KINDS` registry that this spec extends; compile-time metadata enforcement)

**Trigger report**:
- `reports/ai-agent-policy-overhaul-second-iteration.md` (ChatGPT-Pro second iteration, 2026-05-26). This spec adopts the audit's verified concrete gaps (richer role constraints, authored route/map semantics) and rejects the framing that they require a new "DPRT-P" architecture — see §11. The competence requirements in `reports/fitl-competent-agent-ai.md` for ARVN Transport, NVA route logistics, and VC underground positioning supply the concrete authoring need that Spec 191 §2 set as the gate for this follow-on.

**Ticket namespace**: `196ROLECONROUTE` (proposed)

---

## 1. Goal

Close the role-constraint expressiveness gap that Spec 191 deferred, while keeping the engine game-agnostic per Foundation #1. Concretely:

1. **Extend the supported role-constraint kinds** beyond `notEqual` with: `locatedIn`, `distinctOriginDestination`, `reachable`, `adjacent`. Each is a generic, observer-safe constraint over already-bound roles and authored map/graph data; none names a game-specific concept.
2. **Introduce an engine-generic authored-route/map data-asset** that game authors populate to express adjacency, route classes, and movement reachability. The engine reads the data; the kernel does not know what "LoC" or "Trail" mean — those remain authored labels on the generic graph.
3. **Wire the new constraints into the runtime evaluator and compiler validator** so a constraint like `{ reachable: { from: role.transportOrigin, to: role.transportDestination, via: routeClass.land } }` is compile-validated against the authored route data and runtime-enforced.
4. **Migrate the FITL ARVN Transport templates** in two steps: first use `reachable` + `distinctOriginDestination` for route/destination admissibility, then add the generic control/predicate constraint semantics required before origin-control preservation can move out of the current guardrail-penalty workaround (`agents.md:1855-1866`). The split keeps the architecture honest: current generic constraints can prove route admissibility, while origin-control preservation needs a further generic state-dependent constraint surface.

## 2. Non-Goals

- **No game-specific engine kinds.** "LoC", "Trail", "Patronage", "Support" stay in authored data (Foundation #1). The engine learns "route" and "adjacency"; game authors label routes with their game-meaningful tags via `dataAssets`.
- **No structured composite-target identity restructuring.** Pipe-delimited composite identities (`origin|destination`) remain stable identity primitives per Spec 186 / verification. Whether to restructure them is a separate deferred concern (source proposal #2; see §11).
- **No new selector source kinds.** `routePairs` and `subset` enumeration shape is unchanged. Constraints filter the enumerated set; they do not introduce new selector machinery.
- **No doctrine reframe or selection-tier changes.** Spec 197 owns doctrine-gated plan-template eligibility; this spec owns role-target legality.
- **No kernel/legality changes.** Constructibility, the published frontier, and the microturn protocol are unchanged. Constraints are evaluated within the proposer's role-binding pass; the kernel sees only the resulting bound role values.

## 3. Context (verified against codebase, 2026-05-26)

- **Constraint registry (Spec 191 P1 outcome)** — `packages/engine/src/kernel/plan-role-constraints.ts:1`:
  ```ts
  export const SUPPORTED_PLAN_ROLE_CONSTRAINT_KINDS = ['notEqual'] as const;
  ```
  `constraintsSatisfied` in `plan-proposal.ts:426-444` switches on `constraint.kind === 'notEqual'` and otherwise throws via `isSupportedPlanRoleConstraintKind`. The registry is the single source of truth and the extension seam for this spec.
- **Pre-authored `locatedIn` surface (Spec 191 P1 leftover)** — `packages/engine/src/kernel/types-core.ts:1216-1218` already carries the union variant:
  ```ts
  export type CompiledPlanRoleConstraint =
    | { readonly kind: 'notEqual'; readonly role: string }
    | { readonly kind: 'locatedIn'; readonly role: string };
  ```
  Mirrored by the schema (`schemas-core.ts:1436`), the YAML-side shape (`game-spec-doc.ts:799`: `{ readonly locatedIn: string }`), and the lowering (`compile-agent-plan-templates.ts:151`). Spec 191 P1 deliberately left this surface in place and used the registry to compile-reject it (`archive/specs/191-plan-role-semantic-integrity.md:135` and `:145`). Spec 196's work on `locatedIn` lifts the rejection and restructures the payload; it does not introduce a new union slot.
- **YAML constraint parser shape** — `parsePlanRoleConstraint` at `validate-agent-plan-templates.ts:114-124` currently handles only single-string-valued keys (`{ notEqual: <ref> }`, `{ locatedIn: <ref> }`). Object-valued payloads (for `reachable`, `distinctOriginDestination`, `adjacent`, and the restructured `locatedIn`) require extending this parser, the GameSpecDoc YAML union at `game-spec-doc.ts:799`, and the lowering function below.
- **Compiler lowering seam** — `lowerRoleConstraints` at `compile-agent-plan-templates.ts:144-153` is the spec→GameDef seam for constraints; each new kind needs a branch here alongside its validator and runtime evaluator. Current shape lowers to `{ kind, role: <normalized> }`; new kinds need per-shape lowering branches.
- **Authored constraint usage in FITL** — `data/games/fire-in-the-lake/92-agents.md:1025` shows the ARVN Transport template:
  ```yaml
  constraints: [{ notEqual: role.trainSpace }]
  ```
  Only `notEqual` is authored across all FITL templates (verification confirmed; Spec 191 §3 also recorded `locatedIn`×0).
- **Origin-control preservation today (the gap)** — `data/games/fire-in-the-lake/92-agents.md:1855-1866`:
  ```yaml
  arvn.doNotLoseOriginControlByTransport:
    when:
      and:
        - { ref: candidate.tag.transport }
        - lt: [{ ref: feature.projectedSelfMarginDelta }, 0]
    severity: demote, penalty: 550
  ```
  This is a guardrail demote-penalty, not a hard role constraint. It allows the move to remain legal but suppressed — adequate for self-interested ARVN behaviour, but inadequate as the architecture's expression of "destination must be reachable from origin" or "origin must retain control after Transport."
- **Adjacency in conditions but not constraints** — `packages/engine/src/kernel/types-ast.ts` defines `{ query: 'adjacentZones', zone: ZoneRef }` and `{ op: 'adjacent', left: ZoneSel, right: ZoneSel }` for the condition/expression AST. These are usable in `when`/guardrails but are NOT plumbed into the role-constraint evaluator. The query-side machinery this spec needs exists; the constraint-side plumbing is missing.
- **Zone adjacency metadata** — `game-spec-doc.ts:75-80` declares `adjacentTo?: ReadonlyArray<{ to, direction, category }>` on ZoneDef. This is the authored adjacency data; the route layer this spec adds extends it to multi-hop reachability and route-class tagging.
- **Authored `dataAssets`** — `packages/engine/src/kernel/types-core.ts` and `game-spec-doc.ts` define the generic `dataAssets: [{ id, kind, payload }]` mechanism. Route/map data lands as a `dataAssets` entry with a generic `kind: 'routeGraph'` payload schema; no per-game schema file (Foundation #6).
- **Selector source surface** — `compile-agent-selector-sources.ts:42` enumerates the supported source kinds; `policy-selector-eval.ts:145-188` evaluates them. No change to this surface; constraints filter the enumerated sets at role-binding time.
- **Spec 191's deferral gate** — `archive/specs/191-plan-role-semantic-integrity.md:30`: "No new selector sources or constraint kinds. … New constraint kinds are a follow-up justified by a concrete authoring need." This spec is that follow-up; the concrete authoring need is the FITL ARVN Transport / NVA logistics requirement from `reports/fitl-competent-agent-ai.md` §3 (ARVN requirements: "Transport origin/destination pairs," "Avoiding origin control loss after Transport"; NVA requirements: "route/origin/destination reasoning").

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Constraint registry extension

Extend `plan-role-constraints.ts`:

```ts
export const SUPPORTED_PLAN_ROLE_CONSTRAINT_KINDS = [
  'notEqual',
  'locatedIn',
  'distinctOriginDestination',
  'reachable',
  'adjacent',
] as const;
```

`locatedIn` is already a `CompiledPlanRoleConstraint` union variant from Spec 191 P1 (registry-rejected, runtime-unimplemented) with payload `{ role: string }`; this spec lifts the registry rejection AND restructures the payload to carry the container reference. The other three (`distinctOriginDestination`, `reachable`, `adjacent`) are net-new union variants.

Compiled payload shapes in `CompiledPlanRoleConstraint` (`kernel/types-core.ts`):

- `{ kind: 'locatedIn', role, container }` — bound target is positioned within the named zone or within the zone bound to another role. **Restructured from existing `{ role: string }`**; the existing slot has no authored consumers in any game profile, so payload migration is type/schema/lowering-only (Foundation #14: no compat shim).
- `{ kind: 'distinctOriginDestination', origin, destination }` — both roles bound, and `origin.zone ≠ destination.zone` (the common case for movement actions; cheaper-to-author than two `notEqual` permutations against composite role values).
- `{ kind: 'reachable', from, to, via?, maxHops? }` — destination is graph-reachable from origin under the authored route graph, optionally restricted to a route class and a hop budget. `maxHops` defaults to the route data's authored `defaultMaxHops`; absence of route data fails compilation.
- `{ kind: 'adjacent', a, b }` — single-hop adjacency in the authored route graph (a degenerate `reachable` with `maxHops: 1`, surfaced as a separate kind for authoring clarity).

All compiled ref fields (`role`, `container`, `origin`, `destination`, `from`, `to`, `a`, `b`, `via`) are `string`-typed in the compiled artifact, consistent with the existing `CompiledPlanRoleConstraint.role: string` shape. The pseudo-types `RoleRef`, `ZoneRef`, and `RouteClassRef` used in payload prose are presentational labels documenting the authored namespace expected at each position — they are not branded types. Branded-type uplift (Foundation #17) for role/zone/route-class refs is uncommitted and out of scope; if needed later it travels across all role-binding refs uniformly, not constraint-by-constraint.

**Authored YAML shape per kind** (handled by `parsePlanRoleConstraint` and `lowerRoleConstraints`):

- `notEqual: role.X` — single string (existing, unchanged).
- `locatedIn: { role: role.X, container: zone.Y | role.Z }` — object; the existing single-string `locatedIn: role.X` authoring shape is removed in the same change (no authored consumers exist).
- `distinctOriginDestination: { origin: role.X, destination: role.Y }` — object.
- `reachable: { from: role.X, to: role.Y, via?: routeClass.Z, maxHops?: <positive integer> }` — object.
- `adjacent: { a: role.X, b: role.Y }` — object.

The GameSpecDoc YAML union at `game-spec-doc.ts:799` is widened from the closed string-valued shape to admit the object-valued payloads above.

**Extension sites** (per new/restructured kind):

- `plan-role-constraints.ts` — registry entry in `SUPPORTED_PLAN_ROLE_CONSTRAINT_KINDS`.
- `kernel/types-core.ts` — union member with typed payload.
- `kernel/schemas-core.ts` — zod schema for the union member.
- `cnl/game-spec-doc.ts` — authored YAML union widening.
- `cnl/validate-agent-plan-templates.ts` — `parsePlanRoleConstraint` extension, plus per-kind shape checks (roles exist, container/route references resolve, `maxHops` is positive integer) emitting role/template-named diagnostics (Foundation #12).
- `cnl/compile-agent-plan-templates.ts` — `lowerRoleConstraints` per-kind branch.
- `agents/plan-proposal.ts` — `constraintsSatisfied` per-kind branch (see §4.3 for the contract change).

### 4.2 Authored route/map data asset

Introduce a generic `dataAssets` entry kind `routeGraph` with payload schema:

```yaml
- id: fitl.routeGraph
  kind: routeGraph
  payload:
    routeClasses:
      - { id: land, label: Land routes }
      - { id: trail, label: Trail }
      - { id: highway, label: Highway }
    edges:
      - { from: zone.saigon, to: zone.binhDuong, classes: [land, highway] }
      - { from: zone.binhDuong, to: zone.tayNinh, classes: [land] }
      # ...
    defaultMaxHops: 3
```

The engine reads this payload through a new `RouteGraphProvider` interface that compiles into immutable graph indices at GameDef-compile time (Foundation #8 — deterministic compilation; Foundation #13 — recorded in artifact identity via the GameDef hash). The provider exposes only generic queries (`adjacent(a, b, class?)`, `reachable(a, b, class?, maxHops?)`) — no game-specific named queries.

Game authors label route classes ("trail", "highway", "LoC") as authored data; the engine does not know what a "trail" means.

The kind name `routeGraph` is added to the typed `KNOWN_DATA_ASSET_KINDS` registry at `kernel/types-core.ts:1540` (currently `['map', 'scenario', 'pieceCatalog', 'seatCatalog']`) and to its corresponding schema entry in `kernel/schemas-core.ts`. Adding it to the typed registry preserves Foundation #17 for `DataAssetRef.kind` consumers (`types-core.ts:1715`).

### 4.3 Runtime constraint evaluation

`constraintsSatisfied` (`plan-proposal.ts:426-444`) is restructured. The existing function entry-points with `const other = existing[constraint.role]; if (other === undefined) return true;` — this early-return and the single-field `constraint.role` access are `notEqual`-specific and are folded into the `notEqual` branch. Each new-kind branch resolves its own role refs from the constraint payload independently (e.g., `reachable` resolves `existing[from]` and `existing[to]`; `locatedIn` resolves `existing[role]` and dispatches on whether `container` names a zone literal or a role binding). The function signature stays `(binding, constraints, existing) -> boolean`; only its internal contract changes. Role-precedence (Spec 191 P1) already guarantees that every role referenced by a constraint is bound before evaluation; the new branches rely on that guarantee rather than re-implementing the vacuous-pass shortcut.

Per-kind evaluators consult observer-safe state already available to the proposer:

- `locatedIn` reads `state.tokenPositions[role.boundTarget]` (or the zone-containment for zone-typed targets) and compares against the bound container.
- `distinctOriginDestination` is a one-line role-pair compare.
- `reachable` and `adjacent` invoke `RouteGraphProvider` against the GameDef-compiled graph indices, with `maxHops` bounded per Foundation #10.

All evaluators are pure functions of `(state, roleBindings, constraint)`; no side effects, no hidden-state reads. Runtime evaluation receives the current candidate binding separately from prior role bindings, so refs to the constrained role itself are valid while refs to later roles remain invalid. The compiler validator must mirror that contract: accept current-role refs, accept earlier-role refs, and continue rejecting undeclared or later-bound role refs.

### 4.4 FITL ARVN Transport migration

Migrate the ARVN Transport template in `92-agents.md` to express reachability and origin/destination distinctness as constraints. A 2026-05-26 Foundations reassessment split the original origin-control example out of P4A because the current `locatedIn` semantics cannot truthfully express "ARVN-controlled population center" as a fake zone id or post-Transport control preservation. A later 2026-05-26 Foundations reassessment split the missing post-state role-constraint substrate into `196ROLECONROUTE-005A`; `196ROLECONROUTE-005` owns the concrete generic control-preservation constraint and FITL migration once that substrate exists.

```yaml
roles:
  - id: transportOrigin
    selectorId: arvn.transportOrigin
  - id: transportDestination
    selectorId: arvn.transportDestination
    constraints:
      - { reachable: { from: role.transportOrigin, to: role.transportDestination, via: routeClass.land } }
      - { distinctOriginDestination: { origin: role.transportOrigin, destination: role.transportDestination } }
```

The `routeClass.land` reference is an authored label on the route graph, not a game-specific engine kind. The same architecture supports NVA logistics (`via: routeClass.trail`), VC underground movement (a separate `routeClass`), and future games' route taxonomies without engine changes.

## 5. Determinism and replay (Foundations #8, #16)

- Route graph compilation is pure over the GameSpecDoc YAML; `pnpm turbo build` twice produces byte-identical GameDef.
- `RouteGraphProvider` queries return deterministic ordered results (stable hop-by-hop enumeration; ties broken by zone identifier sort order).
- Plan traces with the new constraints replay byte-identically across runs.

## 6. Edge cases

- **Missing route graph asset** — a `reachable` or `adjacent` constraint with no authored `routeGraph` data asset fails compilation with a template/role-named diagnostic. The fallback "reachability via zone `adjacentTo` only" is deliberately not provided — implicit fallback would mask authoring omissions (Foundation #14: no shims).
- **Cyclic route graphs** — supported; `reachable` BFS is hop-bounded so cycles do not unbound traversal (Foundation #10).
- **Multiple route classes per edge** — supported; `via` filters; absence of `via` means any class.
- **Hidden-information zones** — `locatedIn` against a hidden zone is observer-unsafe. The compiler rejects constraints that reference roles whose binding is observer-restricted at the agent's observer scope (Foundation #4 + #20). The check slots into `validate-agent-plan-templates.ts` alongside the existing role-precedence and unsupported-kind checks; observer-scope metadata is sourced from the agent declaration (consistent with Spec 191's existing `targetKind` validation site).
- **Constraint references unbound role** — `reachable: { from: role.A, to: role.B }` where role A is bound after role B in role iteration: the validator enforces constraint role-precedence (Spec 191 P1 already validates this; the new constraints reuse the same precedence machinery).

## 7. Phases & acceptance criteria

| Phase | Deliverable | Acceptance | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | Constraint registry extension (§4.1) | `SUPPORTED_PLAN_ROLE_CONSTRAINT_KINDS` extended; per-kind payload typed in `kernel/types-core.ts`; compiler validates shape (role refs resolve, `maxHops` positive); a fixture template with each new kind compiles; an unsupported kind fails compile; determinism preserved | S–M |
| **P2** | Authored route/map dataAsset (§4.2) | `routeGraph` `dataAssets` kind defined; schema validated at compile time; `RouteGraphProvider` interface + immutable graph index; deterministic compilation byte-identical across two runs; fixture FITL `routeGraph` authored; queries (`adjacent`, `reachable(maxHops)`) tested with golden traversal results | M |
| **P3** | Runtime constraint evaluation (§4.3) | `constraintsSatisfied` evaluates each new kind purely; FITL fixture exercises each constraint; observer-safe state-read contract preserved; plan-trace replay byte-identical | M |
| **P4A-prereq** | Current-role validation alignment (§4.3) | Compiler accepts a constraint reference to the role currently being bound when runtime evaluates the current candidate binding; undeclared and later-bound role refs still fail with role/template-named diagnostics | S |
| **P4A** | FITL ARVN Transport route migration (§4.4) | ARVN Transport template uses `reachable` + `distinctOriginDestination`; FITL routeGraph is authored; witness tests prove unreachable and same-origin/destination bindings are rejected by constraint admissibility, not relegated to scoring | M |
| **P4B-prereq** | Bounded post-state role-constraint evaluation contract (§4.4) | Role constraints can request a generic bounded post-state probe during role binding; compiler validates static shape/refs/bounds; runtime evaluates candidate-specific state deterministically without game-specific branches | M |
| **P4B-prereq 2** | Generic compound post-state probe materialization (§4.4) | Role-constraint post-state probes can materialize generic operation `chooseN` params plus compound special-activity params before evaluating predicates; FITL Train+Transport preserving candidates can be probed without test-only helpers | M |
| **P4B** | Generic control-preservation constraint semantics (§4.4) | A Foundation-compliant generic constraint shape expresses FITL origin-control preservation without fake zone ids or game-specific engine branches; `arvn.doNotLoseOriginControlByTransport` becomes projected-margin-only complement; witness test proves origin-control-losing bindings are rejected by constraint admissibility | M |

## 8. Test plan

- **Compiler error corpus** (architectural-invariant): unsupported constraint kind; missing route graph for `reachable`; `locatedIn` with hidden-info container at agent scope; `maxHops` non-positive; role precedence violation. Each fails with template/role-named diagnostic that replays byte-identically.
- **Route graph determinism** (architectural-invariant): same authored `routeGraph` payload compiled twice produces byte-identical graph indices; `reachable(a, b, maxHops)` returns the same hop-sorted result deterministically.
- **Runtime architectural-invariant**: each new constraint kind, when violated, removes the candidate from the role-binding result set; when satisfied, includes it.
- **FITL route witness**: ARVN Transport scenarios with unreachable or same-origin/destination choices fail constraint admissibility (rather than being scored as legal choices).
- **Post-state role-constraint substrate witness**: owned by `196ROLECONROUTE-005A`; repeated identical role-binding inputs with a bounded post-state constraint produce deterministic admit/reject decisions and proposal traces.
- **FITL control-preservation witness**: owned by `196ROLECONROUTE-005`; ARVN Transport scenarios where origin-control would be lost by the destination choice fail constraint admissibility rather than being demoted by guardrail.
- **Compound post-state probe witness**: owned by `196ROLECONROUTE-005B`; operation plus compound special-activity role bindings materialize a bounded post-state probe without test-only helpers.
- **Determinism**: `pnpm turbo build` twice byte-identical; plan-trace golden replay preserved.

## 9. Foundation alignment

#1 (engine learns generic "route" and "adjacency", not "LoC" or "Trail") · #2 (`routeGraph` payload is GameSpecDoc-resident and evolvable via the standard YAML mutation surface; route classes and edges are first-class evolution targets) · #6 (no per-game schema; `routeGraph` is generic `dataAssets` kind) · #10 (`maxHops` bounded, BFS finite) · #12 (compiler validates everything knowable from spec — route refs, role refs, payload shape) · #14 (constraint registry is single source of truth; no compatibility fallback for missing route data; `locatedIn` payload migration happens in the same change as the registry registration, no compat shim) · #15 (root-cause: closes the constraint-expressiveness gap Spec 191 deferred) · #16 (witness-tested across compiler + runtime + FITL migration) · #17 (compiled refs remain `string`-typed consistent with existing `CompiledPlanRoleConstraint.role`; `RoleRef`/`ZoneRef`/`RouteClassRef` in this spec are presentational, not branded-type uplift, which is out of scope).

## 10. Reassessment of source proposal (`reports/ai-agent-policy-overhaul-second-iteration.md`)

**Adopted (this spec's slice):**
- §3 (proposal #4: richer role constraints — `locatedIn`, `distinctOriginDestination`, `reachable`, `adjacent`) → §4.1 + §4.3.
- §3 (proposal #5: authored route/map semantics) → §4.2 with the corrected framing that engine sees only generic `route`/`adjacency`; "LoC", "Trail" are authored labels.
- §3 (proposal #3: typed target-role schemas) — partially landed via Spec 191's `targetKind` validation; this spec extends per-constraint typing for new kinds in §4.1.

**Corrected:**
- The audit cites `locatedIn` as "parsed but rejected" — stale citation; Spec 191 P1 added `locatedIn` to the `CompiledPlanRoleConstraint` union (`types-core.ts:1216-1218`), schema (`schemas-core.ts:1436`), YAML shape (`game-spec-doc.ts:799`), and lowering (`compile-agent-plan-templates.ts:151`), then used the registry to compile-reject it (`archive/specs/191-plan-role-semantic-integrity.md:135` and `:145`). This spec lifts the registry rejection AND restructures the payload from `{ role: string }` to `{ role, container }` to carry the container reference — which is the work the Spec 191 deferral named.
- The audit's framing that this work requires a "DPRT-P" reframe is rejected — these are constraint-expressiveness additions to the existing architecture, not architectural replacement.

**Deferred (named follow-ups, not in this spec):**
- Structured composite target identity (proposal #2) — pipe-strings preserved; trace-quality concern revisitable when explainability requirements surface.
- Doctrine-gated plan-template eligibility (proposal #1's load-bearing core) — Spec 197.
- Cross-game conformance + observer-safety proofs (proposals #8, #10, #11) — Spec 198.
- Compound availability at root proposal (proposal #7) — Spec 199.
- Cookbook conceptual rewrite (proposal #9) — routed to `reassess-agent-dsl-cookbook` skill (Spec 191 §11 deferral, now triggered post-Spec-190).

**Rejected (with rationale):**
- "Promote doctrine to first-class layer" (proposal #1 reframe) — Spec 191 §11 already rejected this as Foundation #14 churn; the load-bearing decoupling gap is owned by Spec 197 in its smaller, targeted form.
- Game-specific kinds in the engine ("LoC", "Trail") — Foundation #1; route classes stay as authored labels.

## 11. Out of scope (named follow-on / sibling)

- **Spec 197** — doctrine-gated plan-template eligibility (mutually independent).
- **Spec 198** — cross-game conformance corpus + observer-safety proofs (mutually independent).
- **Spec 199** — compound availability at root proposal (mutually independent).
- Multi-hop route cost (weighted shortest path) — uncommitted until a profile needs it.
- Hidden/partial route observability per observer — uncommitted; current scope assumes route graph is public game data (zone connectivity in FITL is public).
